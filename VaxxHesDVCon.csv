0,Pro vaxxers just cannot understand that showing a vaccine reduces chance of death/hosp from COVID (not all causes/in absolute sense) doesn't show vaccines save lives period (assuming they can even do that) only that it has one specific mortality benefit. That is it.,"To show a vaccine actually increases your chance of surviving period, not surviving COVID, or illness and hospitalisation period, not just against covid19, you have to show an overall sum of the benefits and costs by comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated and their total outcome.

It's really telling that pro vaxxers rarely understand this. I just posted a question and like 7+ pro vaxxers already have linked studies saying vaccinated are at lower risk of death FROM COVID, which doesn't prove they are at lower risk of death ... Full stop... 

If those studies are even reliable.",131w2nw,1,214,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/131w2nw/pro_vaxxers_just_cannot_understand_that_showing_a/

3,Bill Gates didn't say that vaccines would reduce the population size. He said vaccines would reduce the need for as many children due to lower mortality rates from diseases.,"This is one place where anti vaxxers have misfired and exaggerated. (I know it's very sensitive to criticise anti vaxxers, I'm not pro vaccine I'm just worried about this false talking point (we need to allow ourselves to point out our errors even if we are mostly on the side of truth)).

A) it's highly unlikely bill gates would be so blunt and nonchalant and say that vaccines are a depopulation weapon.

B) in that clip, bill clearly meant that modern medicine would reduce mortality and therefore reduce the necessity for having so many children, reducing the population.",z6ay2p,0,128,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/z6ay2p/bill_gates_didnt_say_that_vaccines_would_reduce/

8,Isn't it interesting how vaccine injuries are the leading motivator for anti-vaccine activism?,"What that implies is, that someone was at one point willing to get a vaccine, and then got a vaccine injury from that vaccine. 

So they can't really say that this person is ""anti-vaccine"", because this person actually got vaccinated. 

Anti-vaccine people, are mostly Ex-vaccine people. 

They were pro-vaccine enough to go along and get whatever vaccines were required. 

Then they had a bad experience, and stopped taking vaccines, and became Ex-vaccine, 

And then thru their road to recovery, they dig a lot deeper into vaccines, and vaccine problems, 

And then they are called ""anti-vaccine"" when they share what they learn, with people they care about.

Autism is the leading cause of anti-vaccine activism on twitter.

This graphic, created by Vaccinate California Co-Founder Renee DiResta, breaks down antivax activism into sub groups. ""Conservatives"" are green, ""Anti-Vax"" is purple, and ""Autism"" is orange. Clearly, Autism is the single greatest motivator for antivax activism.

17,To my fellow provaxxers,Why is it that these subreddits seem to be overwhelmingly anti covid vax? After I got all three of my jabs I didn't even really follow covid news much but *seems*  like there is a lot of new evidence saying the vaccines did more harm then good. I don't regret taking the vaccines and haven't had any bad side effects and neither has anyone I know who did got jabbed yet i do find it interesting how these subreddits seem to overwhelming in support of the antivax crowd. I have not looked any data or articles so I can't say really whether the evidence is legit but my overall impressions of the covid vaccines is that they failed to live up to the hype and at the end of the day were very mediocre. As someone who's still pro vaccines I have to admit it is interesting to see these subreddits majority anti mrna vax and hearing some of the arguments made by antivaxxers. I'm willing to keep an open mind and I do agree with some points the antivax crowds up and that the covid jabs were mediocre and should not have been mandated. I don't necessarily believe the jabs were made with malicious intent but I do think they were rushed and failed to end the pandemic like they were hyped up to do. Anyway before I get too carried anyway the point of this post is to try and get some brutally honest answers from the pro vax crowd. Do you regret getting vaccinated? Do you maybe not want to admit the antivaxxers may have some good points and that's why these subreddits are majority antivax or are you all tired of arguing? The WHO has declared an end to the covid pandemic and really I'd just like us all to be able to have respectful dialogue once again (both online and IRL). No one really knew how to deal with the pandemic so we all should give each other some slack. Life is short and I'm tired of losing friends because of differing beliefs and I think we all should try to listen to each other regardless of disagreements. This isn't meant to offend anyone i just want a fair and open discussion. Thank you.,13atp3f,12,228,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/13atp3f/to_my_fellow_provaxxers/

41,Do excess deaths show a correlation with vaccination (and mandates) rates? Not really.,"[Some](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/ustfli/the_spike_in_vaccinations_for_ages_2544_lead_to_a/) here have tried [multiple](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/ul50t7/comment/i7t7pth/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) times to show and argue that excess deaths ""spiked"" when vaccinations rates were high and the mandates also helped drive this.

They will argue ""*There were no lockdowns in the U.S during July 2021, so you can’t cite that.*"" and ""*You also can’t blame Delta because you’re essentially admitted the vaccine didn’t protect those people.*""

What they obviously didn't do is do their own research.  Just copied some narrative they had read somewhere and didn't do due diligence.

This is what they want you to see (while hiding the deep dive):

This same pattern follows for other states.

**Low vaccination rate states had extremely high (off the chart) excess deaths**, particularly through that period some people talk about.  Some would argue it was caused by vaccination and vaccine mandates while others would point to this period lining up with Delta.

**High vaccination rate states had much lower excess deaths**.  Some not much higher than normal range.

If vaccines were the cause of excess deaths then we would see excess deaths higher in states with high vaccination, but we don't.  We see the opposite.  The hypothesis looks to be extremely weak.

48,Why can't people just accept it's a bad vaccine? Why go on to say it's not a vaccine at all?,"It makes us look stupid because even people like Bret Weinstein and Dr Malone are calling it not a vaccine but they never give an argument for why it isn't, they don't use defintions or origins of the word vaccine, they just assert it isn't a vaccine.

I've yet to hear a good argument for why it isn't a vaccine. 

Where in the definition of a vaccine does it say you need to directly introduce a piece of the virus into the body? Where does it exclude putting genetic code to produce parts of the virus into the body?

The vaccine sucks, There's no doubt .. but it is a vaccine as far as I can tell.

It is said to be resistant to previous immunity (a euphemism for the vaccine is useless), and more infectious than any previous variant, which seems to be true as cases are exploding (up 30% in the UK last week).

But everyone just assumes this is a repeat of Omicron, which was just a very infectious flu. Health institutions just say there's not enough data and are taking no actions.

What's so disturbing about this is that GVDB warned in May that we'd see a vaccine resistant variant by now, a theory supported by Robert Malone. GVDB said that this variant would seek out the vaccinated, because it evolved to attach itself effortlessly to their vaccine spike proteins. And that this would result in massed deaths among the vaccinated, which I fear is a grave understatement, I expect 99% death rate.

61,"It's a shame I have to explain this like people are 6 years old, but here it is. All cause mortality/morbidity. Net benefit. Net outcome. Overall outcome. Balance of risks and benefits.","If the covid vaccine increase a human beings chances of survival or reduces a human beings chances of a health problem occuring over a given time period (say a year, the best measure would be as long as we have available data for and to continue to monitor as time goes on), then that vaccine is a good thing, it does more good than harm, it may still do harm but the harm would be outweighed so much so that the sum of the harm and the benefit STILL creates benefit. Let's use numbers. 0 is your starting point, before you take the vaccine, positive numbers above 0 mean increased chance of survival or reduced chance of health issues, negative numbers below 0 mean decreased chance of survival or increased chance of health issues (of all types, heart issues, neurological issues, paralysis, any issue).

AFTER you take the vaccine, if you stay at 0 for survival and health, then the vaccine did absolutely nothing for you overall. How could this happen? Two ways. One way is that the vaccine increased your chance of surviving covid by +1 but increased your chances of dying of a blood clot or cardiac arrest, which would be -1, as overall, 1+-1 gets you back to 0.  
The other way is that the vaccine just did absolutely nothing, it was completely useless and completely harmless, it was benign and basically you may as well have given yourself a placebo.

If you end up at +1 for survival and health, then the vaccine was a good thing for you (given that there were no alternatives that were even better of course). This could happen even if there was a significant increased risk of blood clot or cardiac arrest, lets say -1, so long as it increased your chances of surviving covid by +2, as overall, -1+2 = +1.

All I am asking for is evidence that when I vaccinate, I am going to go into positive numbers, not negative or nowhere and stay put.

I will only take the vaccine if I can be provided evidence that if I take it, I will end up above 0.00, and my chances of survival or health goes up. I will accept no mortality benefit with a health benefit (avoiding long covid but not death for example), and I will accept mortality benefit with no morbidity benefit. I may even accept a morbidity cost with a mortality benefit as long as it outweighs it. I may also accept a morbidity gain with a mortality cost, as long as that's a substantial benefit like +4 and the mortality cost is negligible or low like -0.01 or -0.03.

I will not accept a morbidity loss and a mortality loss. I will not accept a mortality wash and a morbidity wash (look up net wash if you don't know what that means).",1338yos,0,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/1338yos/its_a_shame_i_have_to_explain_this_like_people/

* we cannot predict the deadliness of future variants
* we cannot predict the waves of high infection rates
* we cannot predict if existing herd immunity will help to insulate the individual from exposure

Those are just a few examples. I read that the original vaccine clinical trials happened during a period of low infections, so very few participants were exposed to COVID. The results of the trials would have looked different if infections rates had been high.

By comparison, the risks are much easier to predict.

Can heart attacks occur anymore without the mention of the vaccine?",10cnx56,0,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/10cnx56/injuriesheart_attackers/
106,Virus vs vaccine,"There seems to be 2 camps. Pro vax and anti vax. Both sides seem to negate the effects of the actual virus. Pro vax pretend that long covid is not a thing, and so they pretend that being vaccinated means you no longer have to be worried about the virus. Anti vaxers are similar in that regard, they think the vaccine is dangerous but the virus is fine. But in reality it is more complicated than that.

The suspected dangers of the vaccine come from the spike protein. Long covid and neurological damage from mild or asymptomatic covid is also due to the spike protein in most cases.

China has 100s of wet markets across the country. This outbreak started in the 1 city that has an institute of virology. Even Fauci admitted they were doing coronavirus research there, and there were bats pictured in cages, he admitted this, that is why he shifted his focus on trying to say that yes we did this but it did not ""technically"" meet the ""definition"" of ""gain of function"".

The spike protein of this virus is what is abnormal about it. The rest of the virus is normal, like other coronaviruses. Yet only this virus causes all these weird long covid issues, due to the abnormal spike protein. The spike protein is also what causes transmission/infection. Again, this virus is abnormal contagious, that is why it caused a pandemic, while other coronaviruses such as MERS or original SARS did not, they were nowhere near contagious. This is the only virus among these viruses that the animal host was never found for. They found the animal host of the original SARS in weeks. So my guess is that they fkd around with the spike protein of existing coronaviruses in the lab, and this virus accidentally was leaked.

So if you get this virus, I hear a lot of people saying things like 99.9% survival rate. But long covid rates are 5-40%. This spike protein causes weird problems in the body, because it is likely an abnormal/artificial spike protein. We need more research on it. And it is very possible that with repeat infection/the more spike you get in, there is more and more damage over time. Both vaccine and virus have the spike protein. So how can you say vaccine is perfectly safe, or getting infected is fine as long as you are not hospitalized. There are numerous studies that show most people with ""mild"" or ""asymptomatic"" infection got some sort of heart damage, and had less gray matter in the brain. How do we know with repeat infections this won't get worse. Or if it won't culminate in more serious damage later on, such as dementia. Speaking of which, there was a study that showed the spike protein alone of this viruses causes changes in the brain that very closely resemble dementia. So unless we do more research, how do we know in a few years millions won't get heart attacks or brain damage, from either vaccine or virus? Also, people in their 30s/40s/50s getting heart attacks out of nowhere, even though they did not get severe covid. Who knows what caused that, vaccine, virus, or both?",12m8f4j,2,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/12m8f4j/virus_vs_vaccine/

110,"We have absolutely no idea what is coming out of China 4 days from now, how this new variant will interact with Western vaccines after spending 3 years in a locked down Chinese breeding ground, and we won't know until it's too late","This is truly absurd. China just went through their biggest spike in Covid cases yet, only their second in 3 years, just about everyone there is probably a carrier by now. They've been locked down for most of that time in the most extreme ways possible, meaning their virus ecosystem was largely separated from the rest of the world.

So we have no idea what kind of viruses they have there now (the WHO is complaining about their lack of data sharing), and what happens when those are exposed to the rest of the world, other virus variants, and specifically to the Western vaccines, which might trigger a different response from what the vaccinated Chinese got (who for all we know got a different vaccine than what China exported).

And that's ignoring that these might be lab made bioweapons released with purpose and intent. China shut down the world in 2020, surviving it better than anyone, as well as internal protests in Hong Kong and surrounding their real estate and bank failures, talk about perfect timing. What if it was not an accident, and they're about to repeat their little trick.

In which case it's already certain to work, as countries world wide are putting out welcome signs to Chinese tourist spending with barely even testing requirements, including the US and Europe. 3 years worth of pent up Chinese tourism is about to be spread world wide at the speed of sound, and by the time the effects of this new variant are determined it might already have spread beyond anyone's control. The US broke 1 million Omicron cases in just one month, this is probably even faster, and hospitals are already at maximum capacity as it is, thanks to all these sudden mysterious illnesses.

I've seen this come up occasionally online and I want to know where does this come from? And is there any weight behind this claim that people who get vaccinated will experience some sort of debilitating side effects at some point in the future ranging from 2 to 10 years after vaccination. I don't understand this claim because side effects are typically seen days after vaccination and also the strength of the vaccine wanes over time, so it doesn't make sense to me how suddenly all the side effects hit you years after vaccination. Like I said, I just want to know where this claim comes from and if there's any weight to it.

The entire justification for vaccinations is built on the unproven notion that viruses even exist. Viral contagiousness is how they push vaccines, masks, lockdowns, control, everything! And it is a house of cards. The emperor wears no clothes! 

Germ theory makes all of this control through removing bodily autonomy justified. Terrain theory on the other hand would justify the removal of toxins from our air, water, and soil. So $$ incentive for more than just big pharma to perpetuate the lies. 

To move beyond the same old debate about variants and ADE etc. debate the existence of viruses! Can anyone prove the Covid virus even exists? That any viruses exists? That a virus has ever been truly isolated and proven to be contagious?? Are vaccines anything more than expensive poison design solely to make us pharma cash cows?

To me, this seems completely unfair to Pfizer. Probably Pfizer told the pregnant women to let them know if anything odd happened related to their pregnancies. Only 32 of the 270 women contacted Pfizer, because the other 238 had no problems to report. In that case, these problems were probably not too far above the background rate for pregnancy problems.

[Another](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.30.21258079v1) was of women undergoing in vitro fertilisation and it demonstrated that the Moderna vaccine has no detectable effect on the percentage of clinical pregnancies resulting from the procedure.

[Another](https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Fulltext/9900/Severe_Acute_Respiratory_Syndrome_Coronavirus_2.206.aspx) has shown that vaccination has no effect on immunological tolerance of the fetus by the mother.

[Another](https://www.fertstertreports.org/article/S2666-3341(21)00068-4/pdf) study did not find any effect on embryo implantation rates between SARS-CoV-2 infection seropositive, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine seropositive or seronegative women.

The literature is strongly supportive of the conclusion that vaccination does not have any effect on female fertility. It's important to note that these studies all examined women undergoing in vitro fertilisation procedures so the women who took part are not representative of all reproductive age women which makes these results even worse for the claim that COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility.

Most women undergo in vitro fertilization because of difficulty conceiving so it would be expected that such women would be more susceptible to anything that might impact female fertility.

There's a lot of talk on here about covid being a bio weapon. In that case, wouldn't it be equally if not more deadly than the vaccines? How do you balance the risk of getting vaccine side effects and the risk of being infected with a deadly man made virus?

>Conclusions  
>  
>COVID-19 infection, including long-COVID, is associated with increased short- and long-term risks of COVD and mortality. Ongoing monitoring of signs and symptoms of developing these cardiovascular complications post diagnosis and up till at least a year post recovery may benefit infected patients, especially those with severe disease.

This was a study of people in the first year of the pandemic, so pre-vaccine.

They found that those who caught the disease between March and November 2020 were found to be up to 81 times more likely to die within the first three weeks of infection.

And they remained up to five times more likely to die than uninfected people a year-and-a-half later.

Patients also had a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease, again up to 18 months after infection.  This included coronary heart disease, heart failure and deep vein thrombosis.

Lead study author Professor Ian Wong stated ""*The historical control cohort was included to rule out the effect of routine health care services being reduced or cancelled during the pandemic, which led to worsening health and increased mortality even in uninfected people.*""

As it was from 2020, up to 18 months would lead into 2021.  Many people, such as the younger population, weren't vaccinated until mid-2021, which would take us through 2022 based on the period of 18 months.

This adds another piece of the puzzle to what is causing excess deaths.

* Delayed care / Lack of timely care
* Delayed diagnosis
* Mortality displacement

And we can add long term risk from COVID to that.",10fzfm2,10,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/10fzfm2/association_of_covid19_with_short_and_longterm/

Agree?,"As in a vaccinated person suffering from bloodclots doesnt directly mean it was caused by the vaccine. statistic maybe good sign that it very well maybe but it cannot be used as evidence to prove that is indeed so. it might at best be used as a backing on hard evidence but not as standalone.

a guy who had 10 cases of thief might make us suspicious that he may very well be responsible for the 11th, but it isnt good enough to prove that is the case. just like someone who often lies may very well speak the truth.

just like many things that are deemed dangerous, for example living near high tension wires, high powered dishes or even microwave oven, even if statistic shows that theres an increase in cases, no scientists could find any solid evidence about it so they are still deemed safe by authorities and people should agree with it u less they can find proof to show otherwise.

161,Maybe pharma will make the bivalent COVID vaccines safer.,"Maybe pharma will make the bivalent COVID vaccines safer.

What do you think of that idea? Maybe they have decided that the current vaccines are simply too obviously harmful (even if they were expected or intended to be somewhat harmful). Maybe they want to correct their mistake without publicly admitting that they made a mistake?

For example, they might have determined that further COVID boosters are unnecessary or even harmful, yet there are still people clamoring for an updated booster. Why not make a booster that does no good but also does no harm? Why not take all the crazy adjuvants out of it and reduce the mRNA to trace amounts.

This would confuse the debate about the COVID vaccines. Already, people do not distinguish between the different brands of the vaccines. Adding a new vaccine that is truly safe would help to cover their tracks.",wz8bth,4,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/wz8bth/maybe_pharma_will_make_the_bivalent_covid/
162,"Samsung has been mass producing 5nm microchips since 2020, so why wouldn't it fit in a vaccine?","Just in October 2021 the CNBC posted this fact checking article to disprove the microchip theory: [https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/10/01/why-theres-no-5g-tracking-microchip-in-the-covid-vaccine.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/10/01/why-theres-no-5g-tracking-microchip-in-the-covid-vaccine.html)

They argued that the smallest RFID microchips are 0.1mm big, plus antenna they would never fit inside a 0.4mm needle.

This is confusing to me because In July 2020 it was reported that Samsung was mass producing 5nm microchips: [https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/07/30/samsung-5nm-chipset-mass-production/](https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/07/30/samsung-5nm-chipset-mass-production/)

Now it's not quite clear just how big a chip would need to be to be useful, but by the sound of it they can get it down to nm scale. 1mm is 1,000,000nm, so the RFID chip the CNBC mentions is 100,000nm, or 20,000 times bigger than what Samsung is producing. For scale, Covid is 90nm, and Ebola is 1,000nm.

So it does sound like they can easily fit microchips into the vaccines, and have had at least one bulk production line several months before the vaccine production started.",wgxabn,5,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/wgxabn/samsung_has_been_mass_producing_5nm_microchips/

210,"Let's get this straight, bill gates is dangerous, I do not like bill gates. However, he did not say in a TED talk that vaccines would be used to lower the population. Here's why.","He said ""The world today has 6.8 billion people. That’s headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent.""

What does he mean by ""that"" by 10 percent.

He means, the projected population peak we are headed towards. 

It's in the previous sentence, it's clear he was referring to that projection of growth not the actual population itself.

In other words he said, ""We can use vaccines, reproductive health services and health care to reduce the population growth"" not to ""reduce the current population""

It is a fact that if people have a good health care and access to good vaccines they won't have as many children, partners won't have 7 kids in their lifetime because they are worried they might lose some of their kids from diseases and illnesses.
Of course whether or not the vaccines are good or the healthcare is good is up for debate, and I don't believe they will help as much as he might think or that they are as well motivated as many people think.

It is a fact that if people have good reproductive health services, people will not have as many children because less women will become pregnant less often.

214,What is coming next,"The CRISPR shots will no longer be available.  They are going to reveal the ""gifts"" that it gave to ""the faithful"", chiefly among them will be: 

1. artificial intelligence (but absolutely no short-term memory)
2. Intense, short-lived bursts of speed and agility (overdrive) coupled with seeming fearlessness
3. Skills they should not be able to have mastered so quickly or at such a young age (gain of function)
4. A dramatic change in the personality of someone you have been close to forever.  This will hurt the most, I promise.  They will mock you mercilessly and go on about how ""brave"" and ""patriotic"" they were for taking the shots. 
5. ""Stability"" which will just be emotionless cruelty towards animals or people
6. An overriding obsession with blue light  (specifically at 470nm).  They are going to want this more than any drug.  It will be their weakness and their reward.  Also gold light and to a degree red, but none will be devoured as much as the bluecifer shine.
7. What seems like incredible strength (this is actually just a temporary dearth of exhaustion) 
8. Complete observability.  This means everything they see, everything they say, everything they hear, everything they touch- it all goes to a NSA computer as soon as they fall asleep next.  Even if they are blindfolded, the Air Force's ABMS can pick up their signal to within 2cm anywhere on the globe, even underground.
9. This last one is the big one.  ""Double redundancy"" means they each get 3 lives.  You can kill them twice, and they may not get up for the third, but that will only be because a molecular ""image"" of them is stored ""off-premises"", ie an data center somewhere distant.

With how terrible things are about to become, you will feel some jealousy.  After all, the ""Artemis generation"" will seem like gods.  Don't envy them.  They are rotting inside.  They are no longer the masters of their soulless bodies, but they cannot look away as the signal in their brain tells their dead corpse where to go and what to do.  This is called Control Theory, or at least it was in the 1960s, but now it may be known as Dynamics.

Have you seen those commercials for Boston Dynamics with the white plastic robot dancing and cartwheeling?  This is the robot.  The one on tv was a distraction.  The robot is a living human + a ""virus"", sometimes known as an RTOS (real time operating system).

Was this pandemic more a scenario A) where the lion was real and really causing the problems? Or was it more like a scenario B) where the lion was fictional or a tiny baby lion that scratched your arm a little and walked away, and most of the problem was in the OVER reaction to the lion that wasn't the lions fault.

235,Episode #1 : What Makes This Study Stink?,"The Incidence of Myocarditis and Pericarditis in Post COVID-19 Unvaccinated Patients-A Large Population-Based Study.

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35456309/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35456309/)

**What Makes This Study Stink?**

1. The study only included myocarditis and pericarditis diagnoses made at least ten days after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, when patients are recovering, but not cases during COVID-19 itself.

Why is this important?

It's never a good look to cherry-pick.  One can get myocarditis during acute COVID.  The authors themselves acknowledged: “It has recently been reported that the incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis is increased in COVID-19 patients during the acute illness”.

It makes sense to do this if one was creating a study that would go on to be spread among anti-vaxxers that COVID-19 doesn’t increase the risk of heart inflammation.  Get the result you want and let the ignorant repeat it ad nauseam.

2. The study also included only a limited subset of myocarditis and pericarditis diagnostic codes, leaving out in particular diagnostic codes specific for myocarditis associated with viral infection.

Why is this important?

The chosen diagnostic codes don’t capture all myocarditis and pericarditis cases. Critically they didn’t include diagnostic codes for viral myocarditis (B33.22) and infective myocarditis (I40.0).

Thus if a patient had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and developed myocarditis afterwards their case might not have been included since COVID-19-associated myocarditis is the result of an infectious disease caused by a virus.

The inclusion of only a subset of relevant ICD codes may have led the authors to identify only a small number of cases.

Two cherry picks and counting.

3. The way that the authors defined the control group; specifically as people who tested negative for COVID-19.

Why is this important?

A key reason for getting a COVID-19 test is because you have symptoms that resemble COVID-19.  Even if these people didn’t have COVID-19, they likely had some other infection. And this is relevant since a viral infection is one of the most frequent causes of myocarditis.

In other words the authors didn’t detect an increased risk in COVID-19 patients because these patients were compared to a control group that was made up of many people who were also at an elevated risk of myocarditis and pericarditis.

A study going against the grain needs to bring more to the table.  It's competing against methodologically sound studies such as [https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2110475](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2110475) and [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01689-3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01689-3) and [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01689-3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01689-3).",zec4h1,2,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/zec4h1/episode_1_what_makes_this_study_stink/

> Long term effects. If any changes happen down the road. How you feel when you catch a new varient or other similar virus. 

I know a bunch of people who have had COVID now, some more than once, but I haven't caught it yet, or it's been asymptomatic, despite going to work 5 days a week without a mask and going to the gym twice a week without a mask.  *shrug*

I also got a booster shot, which I logged [here](https://old.reddit.com/user/Federal_Butterfly/comments/so5r9k/booster_appointment_tomorrow/). It gave me the sensation of being ill but without the sniffling and other respiratory side effects, just the feeling of tiredness and achiness all over.  I was out of commission for a day, then felt some ""chest weakness"" a few times over the next two weeks, then that went away, too and I've been normal since.  

I wasn't sure if the booster was really even necessary (since the FDA advisory committee and WHO don't recommend them for people under 65) and I probably won't get another.

> You accepted the experimental vaccine, be sure to do your due diligince and report anything suspicious down the road.

Haven't had any symptoms except the ones I reported within two weeks of each dose.

Then I saw others say they got a booster, but they won't need more than that.

Then White House Covid Czar Dr. Ashish K. Jha said the following: "" Right now, we're going to have to update our vaccine in the fall in winter; Because of what we have out there. **I do believe that right now people who are 15 and above should go out and get that second booster because we have so much infections.** In the short run, yeah, like we've had to boost people about every 6 months.** Over the long run, I am confident we're going to develop more durable vaccines. The virus is also going to settle down. And so, my hope is over the long run it's going to be maybe a once a year shot but right now we have to boost people maybe a little bit more frequently because of how frequently the virus continue to evolve.""   (Source: https://rumble dot com/v15fhv1-white-houses-covid-czar-makes-grim-prediction-that-americans-will-need-endl.html )

So even if you're under 50, you should have 4 doses total, according to Dr. Jha.  

So it sounds like some of the pro-covid vaccine users here are insufficiently enthusiastic and are disappointing Dr. Jha. And that's not cool. Vaccine hesitancy is really not cool at all.    

Can we get a consensus please? How many doses do you need to get to not be considered a threat to public health and an anti-vaxxer by the end of this year? I think if you haven't had 4, and you don't plan on getting 6, you need to be quarantined.        

Please share some concrete numbers.   

According to Dr. Jha, it sounds like you should have at least 4 this year, and then probably at least 2 by the end of next year. And then you'd need another 2 at least the next year. So 8 may be the minimum for real safety looking at the next two years...   

So you should have 6 doses by the end of next year? I'm not sure that's enough. I'm just trying to stay safe out here.    

How many doses do you currently have? If it's not 4, as suggested by the venerable expert Dr. Jha, please state why you are against trusting the expert. As far as Dr. Jha and I are concerned, you are a serious threat to public health.    

How many doses will you have had by the end of this year?      
How many doses will you have had by the end of next year?      

Right now, in the USA, only 16 million people, or roughly 5% of the population, has had 4 doses (see https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total     

And under 1/3 of the population has had 3 doses (see the same link just above).

But of course unlike the controlled dosage of vaccines, long term effects of covid depends on few variables like the virus dosage exposure and body immune system.

But if the vaccine based on covid19 spike can cause infertility and myocarditis, what makes you think natural immunity is safe? i keep hearing folks saying that they rather purposely get infected to reach natural immunity thinking it is safe because they think they beat covid because it felt like mild flu.

&#x200B;

**China has approved its first home-produced mRNA Covid vaccine, months after ending strict pandemic rules.**

Drug regulators cleared the vaccine, developed by CSPC Pharmaceutical Group, for emergency use, the company said.

China's labs have been trying to create an mRNA vaccine for years - the country refused to clear foreign-made ones for widespread domestic use.

Studies show Chinese vaccines have been less effective than mRNA shots in preventing deaths and severe illness.

The slow expansion of China's vaccine rollout, coupled with its lack of an mRNA vaccine, fuelled the implementation of its ""zero-Covid"" policy, which included unprecedented lockdowns and was dropped after protests late last year.

China has mainly used only its domestically produced vaccines: CoronaVac, made by a company called Sinovac, and Sinopharm.

Both use parts of a dead coronavirus to expose the body to Covid and stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies.

The mRNA technology was used commercially for the first time in Covid vaccines. The jabs use a molecule of genetic code called messenger RNA to generate an immune response. That trains the body to fight off the real virus when it comes into contact with it.

CSPC said the vaccine showed good results in a trial when used as a booster vaccine for those who had already received other shots.

The incidence of adverse events was ""substantially lower"" in the elderly group compared with the adult group, it said.

The news comes as cases fall in the world's most populous country. Last month, China's top leaders declared a ""decisive victory"" over Covid.",11zf3xq,2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/11zf3xq/article_china_approves_first_homegrown_mrna_covid/

301,Email Received Today From Our Pediatricin," Are you confused about the new CDC COVID guidelines released yesterday and why the relaxation?  
Here’s my two cents- (remember you get what you pay for! )

The CDC has changed its goals  from preventing transmission and community outbreaks at the population level to preventing serious disease, hospitalization and death at the individual level. So understand the policies in that context.  

We are in a different and better place now than two years ago.  We have significant percent of the population immunized or having had Covid or both (Although pediatric immunization rates are still too low and adult booster rates are still too low despite very strong data showing lower hospitalization and lower long covid if up to date on vaccines.) 

I’m not convinced that  just focusing on severe disease alone without trying to reduce transmission will work.  

Realize we still have over 400 deaths per day in this county.  That’s 2800 per week!  146,000 per year!   That is still not acceptable.  We must continue to work at the population level to reduce deaths.  To do that we need better data to understand who is dying and why, when most deaths could be prevented. 
Unimmunized? Not boosted? No access to Paxlovid?  Over 65?  Other at risk conditions? 
Once we figure that out, we can continue to work on increasing immunization uptake, better access to antivirals, and informing those at high risk how to protect themselves. 

So let’s look at the new guidance
1) end isolation after 5 days
IMO this is still short sighted by the CDC. 
There is strong data showing over 70% still have positive antigen tests for 8-10 days with the current variant BA.5.   And peak viral loads are around day 4-5.   The guidance says wear a mask for another 5 days and avoid contact with high risk people- but we know people are not wearing masks, and many are traveling and back to work while still infectious!  

2) Not recommending testing to exit isolation is not a smart policy!  (I think they don’t want to deal with inequity and fact that people in lower income populations don’t have access to enough tests.)  

Rapid antigen tests are the only tool we have to know if someone is likely infectious.  Yes, they aren’t perfect, but they are pretty good when used at the right time.  
People think they don’t work because they can be negative until day 3-4 of infection.  If you have symptoms and a negative test in first few days- don’t assume it’s NOT covid!  It still could be.  ( remember the difference between infected and infectious!   If you are infected and rapid antigen is negative early on- you likely are not that contagious yet!  )

But if using rapid tests  on day 5-7,  they are very accurate- if positive- infectious-stay home!   If negative - not infectious- remember we are looking at day 5-7, not days 1-3!  
And, I’ve been saying for over a year now and now the data supports it, two tests 24-48 hour apart is the most accurate! 

Going out with a cloth mask or NO mask on day 5 just doesn’t make sense if you are testing positive. 

They do say - “If you have access to antigen tests, you should consider using them. With two sequential negative tests 48 hours apart, you may remove your mask sooner than day 10.”

Of note VDH does say that if you can’t wear a mask all the time for days 6-10, you should have a negative test after day 6 to go out of isolation. 

2) understanding the CDC community transmission map is confusing-it is designed to tell us as a community what to do if hospital usage is high, but unfortunately doesn’t really tell individuals when to put masks back on!   People need to know what community transmission is to make personal decisions.  We have lost that data reporting.  ☹️

Bottom line, when you are hearing that everyone is getting sick, it’s a good time to mask.   If you want to unmask - wait until community transmission gets lower. 

3) Quarantine  - CDC no longer recommends quarrantine if exposed.  You should wear a high grade mask for 10 days and test on day 6 and use caution around high risk individuals.  

This will keep more people at work and more kids in school , but we will definitely see increased outbreaks as asymptomatic people continue to transmit.  

4) routine screening tests- they don’t recommend routine testing of asymptomatic people.  (Again - their goal is preventing serious disease not controlling transmission).

We are stuck in a vicious policy conundrum. The CDC is now not recommending community public health policies but rather telling individuals how to protect themselves- meeting people where they are realizing no one was following their guidelines anyway, and they get political pressure too,- remember they are not independent and funded by congress. So making public health policy but balancing it with economic and political pressure makes it impossible to just follow the science. 
CDC says end isolation at day 5, then employers require people back at work,  which drives inequity.  High wage white collar jobs work from home but lower wage and  blue collar jobs can’t- so guess which communities see higher rates of infection!  ☹️. But the other side is if you require longer isolation, many low income low wage earners can’t afford to miss work. 

Bottom line- until case rates drop significantly, wear a high grade mask indoors.  Be sure you have all your boosters.  And Immunize your kids!  The benefits still outweigh the very small tiny risk of immunization.
And early data is showing lower long covid in immunized! 

Side note- long covid- this week a handful of new papers reported identifying areas of the immune system ( certain cells and inflammatory markers) that are different  in long covid patients. One study showed markedly lower cortisol levels.  These were all relatively small studies -what I call  initial first round research.  But they will lead to larger studies and hopefully in 6-12 months we might have some answers!  Hoping,,,

305,What is the difference between 'us' and 'them'?,"I bumped into and had a chat with a nice acquaintance. This lady is one of those who has never looked at the 'pandemic' anywhere but on TV. I thought what would be the point for me to raise a concern relating to published data regarding vaccines and their devastating toxicity - or any of the lies - now exposed? The paradigm that she is living in is so alien and fantastic and illogical. It would be no more useful to her than if I started to tell her about brain surgery. 

There is it seems some fundamental difference of 'priority' and 'order' at the core of our beings that has led to a complete incompatibility of awareness in the two groups.

I have articulated this to myself as;

Many people appear to me to have prioritized the animal in themselves to an extraordinary and to an exclusive degree and moment. This has led to a complete collapse in them, of the faculties of judgement, aesthetic enthusiasm and of intuition, because the animal appetites have no need of those things in order to be supplied. Such people may 'appear' to have other interests and concerns, ones seemingly apart from the 'animal'; but they present as such merely and only because they believe it will facilitate a superior gratification of the animal, which in their beings is the only and the singular object of their entire attention.

There is no aesthetic faculty in these people and no sense of beauty at all.

This is how I try to make sense of people who have never had any interaction with the pandemic or the vaccines or any of the other related ethical concepts and necessities of the atrocities - apart from via their TV.",xgg9tt,9,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/xgg9tt/what_is_the_difference_between_us_and_them/

324,To laboratory or not to laboratory? - That is the question.,"I think that any attention placed upon the question 'Where did covid come from' is something unproductive and pointless to consider. It lends credence to the bogus idea that 'Covid - 19' is dangerous, and it supports the notion that in an ideal situation a 'vaccine' might or would be part of a 'solution' to a (virus or no virus) non existent threat.

Covid - 19 was a development of marketing - of the perverted imagination of ravenous criminals. In what sense a 'real' virus might be required to fortify the power of the hoax, has not been established. There is no evidence that any such virus was needed to create the murderous effect - the mindless terror and the mindless suicidal compliance with mass murder, which was welcomed with hateful screams of 'Stay safe! Stay safe! (the face mask being the modern equivalent of the Nazi salute); so happily adopted and indulged in by the terrified and deluded mass.

The 'pandemic' the marketing event - very obviously is/was unrelated to any real world phenomena, such as a virus or anything else. Speculating about the 'origin' of 'Covid - 19' merely supports the fantasy that humanity was presented with some sort of a novel emergency, when it wasn't.

Whatever the fact or reality of infectious disease is or was in the 'pandemic' - it is completely obvious that if the people had never been told about it, in a gigantic psychological terror attack - none of us would have anything happening in our lives to suggest to us that there was a global pandemic happening that the media and government was ignoring.

But for the public their use is more akin to religion, as people believe they work when those in power now admit that they never did. The fact that they rushed product testing and refused to release the clinical trial data confirms that this whole thing is the opposite of science.

The Covid vaccines are a cult, religious zealotism, that reached new heights of insanity when they approved them for the youngest children, causing many of the CDC top people to quit in disgust.

And this error of mistaking religion for science is likely to cost the vaccinated dearly, as leaky vaccines show that we are to expect endless more variants, until one of them turns deadly. And when that happens it will be the vaccinated that'll find their immune systems have become toothless, and what used to be a new kind of flu has become a deadly plague.",w9b6xj,198,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/w9b6xj/the_covid_vaccine_is_the_opposite_of_science_it/

372,Marek Disease & Wiping out Unvaccinated,"Leaky vaccines prevent the development of disease symptoms, but do not protect against infection and the onwards transmission of pathogens ([source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0358-3)). This is clearly how the covid vaccines (or gene therapies) seem to work -- although there's still some reasonable doubt if they prevent disease symptoms/death at all. I think it should be more highlighted that the vaccines are *at the very least* leaking. These studies are based on experiments using chickens.

The study from the first source claims that this may be no issue to those who are unvaccinated and that there may be benefits to a leaky vaccine. But another science website reports that those who received a leaky vaccine could easily cause a more deadlier mutation to survive and escape and that this would kill those who have never been vaccinated (at least in the case of chickens):

*Some vaccines may cause viruses to evolve into deadlier forms, a new study suggests. Chickens that are vaccinated against a strain of Herpes known as Marek's virus/disease may allow the unvaccinated birds in the flock to catch a deadlier version of the same virus. The effect has so far been demonstrated with just one bird virus, though it's possible it may also occur with some human vaccines, the researchers said.* ***Still, among humans, the evolution of the virus into a deadlier strain would only be possible in cases where vaccinated people can still spread a virus even if they show no symptoms of disease***.

*In a series of experiments, the team found that the vaccination of chicks led to the spread of ""hotter strains"" of the virus —* ***deadlier versions that killed unvaccinated members of the flock more quickly*** ([source](https://www.livescience.com/51682-vaccines-evolve-deadlier-viruses.html)).

And honestly it seems far more logical to kill the unvaccinated, or that the government has the intention to kill the unvaccinated as they are already seem to think about our deaths a lot. Why wouldn't you keep the easily controllable population alive, instead of people you despise as oppositional conspiracy theorists? We should obviously skip the vaccines because for the majority, the risks outweigh the benefits, but this could also turn against us in the future if the studies done on chickens also applies to us.

For so far no deadlier variant has resulted from the vaccines, in fact there's enough proof to suspect that Omicron is probably the least deadliest variant, but with people who keep taking boosters for this cold there's always the risk of a more deadlier variant coming out. **There are already warnings from both some scientists and the government, but they contradict each other when it comes to pointing out the at-risk group.** Perhaps all those scientists telling us to never get vaccinated are part of the plan to keep a relatively large number of people unvaccinated for the long term hoax pandemic while this will kill us because of vaccinated people who keep using leaky vaccins that cause deadly mutations that target us unvaccinated people. 

I suspect the only solution is to stop the vaccines for good, for everyone in the middle of pandemic, no matter the age or health status, there shouldn't be an excuse to use a leaky vaccine simply to have a beer or get a false sense of safety. For us, everyone here should catch Omicron and build some immunity against future covid related strains. Otherwise it could be the vaccinated that are soon killing both unvaccinated people and those who had no benefit from the ineffective vaccines, since they are acting like superspreaders. **For those among us who stay unvaccinated, maybe we need a real lockdown for ourselves when the supposedly super-deadly mutant shows up, just to stay safe.**",vicwyr,11,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/vicwyr/marek_disease_wiping_out_unvaccinated/

my ""education"": 

completely self-directed. 

i go at my own pace. 

i am free to drop-off, and pick-up, on any line of inquiry.

i am free to change my mind. 

i am free to challenge authority.  

since August 27, 2014, i have been focused on just one single question, which is, 

""WHAT CAUSES AUTISM?""

and i have gone down every rabbit hole, 

heard every perspective, 

followed-up on every lead, 

and of all of these avenues of inquiry, all road lead back to vaccines. 

but it is not enough to just say that all of the evidence points to the fact that  ""vaccines cause autism"", 

i take it a step further, and ask how exactly it is, that vaccines cause autism?

and the answers come directly from mouths of the parents of autistic children. 

the story is remarkably the same, from family to family, 

infant is perfectly healthy, goes in for a ""well-child"" visit, 

pediatrician gives infant a vaccine, or 2, or 3, or 6, or even 8

and then the infant has a ""strong"" immune response, 

and dies of ""SIDS"" (sudden infant death syndrome)

and if the infant is lucky enough to survive at all, 

their immune response causes irreversible brain damage, 

and the infant's brain is so inflamed by the vaccine induced immune response, 

that the infant is literally banging his head against the wall in agony. 

my ""education"" didn't come from a pre-planned, pre-determined syllabus.   

i didn't consume and regurgitate the exact same trivia as every other student. 

i was able to linger on a concept for as long as needed, and to not feel rushed on to the next topic. 

while you were busy learning about 100 things being pushed at you, 

i was focussed on JUST ONE THING: AUTISM

i have reviewed all of the so-called ""literature"" related to vaccines and autism, 

i listened to all sides, making points-and-counter points. 

i was able to entertain multiple contradictory concepts in my mind, at the same time, 

without fear of getting it right, or getting it wrong, on any test. 

i was able to revisit my views, and change my mind, when i learned new things, 

my views were not ""etched in stone"" or ""written down"" as the supposedly correct answer, for all time. 

i didn't get hooked on the dopamine hits, when i got good grades for regurgitating trivia. 

i wasn't driven by a schedule,

i wasn't driven by a desire to ""graduate"", 

i wasn't thinking of my own 'graduation"" as the end of my ""education"". 

i had ONE QUESTION:

""what causes autism? 

""WHAT CAUSES AUTISM?""

and the current state of the debate is, that all of the so-called ""anti-vaccine"" side knows that vaccines cause autism, 

and the reason they know that vaccines cause autism, is because they watched it happened with their own 2 eyes. 

""autism"" is the single-biggest motivator for anti-vaccine activism on twitter, 

and the only people who are saying that vaccines DO NOT cause autism, is the pro-vaccine side!

but because the pro-vaccine side is such a wide spectrum, it appears as if the pro-vaccine side is a consensus across every discipline of science. 

when the truth of the matter is, there are very few vaccine scientists, in the whole scheme of things. very few people who really understand how vaccines work, and how the immune system works, 

so consequently, all of the other so-called scientists who don't know anything about vaccines and the immune system, simply defer to other authorities,

which is why you NDT, who is an astro-physicist by training, making a pro-vaccine documentary, even though he doesn't know the first thing about vaccines or the immune system.

391,"To those ""Andrew Wakefield falsified data!"" people.","You know where the falsification idea came from? It's because the info in his paper for the children was inconsistent with the data from the medical records of the children.

Do you know there is absolutely no evidence that this inconsistency was caused by actual fudging or anything like that? Not one thing proves that. Try and find one.

You won't.

Now the real explanation is that 4 co-authors and also specialists, assessed the children, and came to a new and more rigourous determination of the condition of the children.

That is what explains the discrepancy. 

From analysing this article/document.

The claim is here, that because the patient's cases were differently described in the paper compared to NHS medical records, that the data was fabricated.

There's a few hugely important explanations to be aware of before this leads you to categorically conclude that fabrication was involved:

A) In the GMC hearing, the defence of these inconsistencies, was that the reason these records did not match up with the data in the study, was because the children had designedly been sent off for a re-analysis of their condition by 2 neuropsychiatric specialists and multiple gastrointestinal specialists along with the rest of the Co-Authors who were top in their field, some even, specifically having expertise focus in autism and similar developmental disorders. And that the re-analysis was significant, and a new diagnosis altogether was given to the patients and it was updated.

This would be a fairly reasonable defence, as 3 of the Co-Authors were IN FACT such specialists and were very qualified to make such assessments, far more so than the GPs that sent the children to the Royal Free Hospital who on their letters of admission wrote that they ""could not explain what was making the children sick and how to treat them"", and needed specialists at the royal free to help.

B) Which leads us onto the fact most of the children were referred to the Royal Free by their GP's because the parents were not satisfied with the GP's lack of answers. The Royal Free was a top hospital and Andrew, John, and the rest of the team, were at the time considered some of the top specialists in the country, and even across Europe.

C) In Brian Deer's article [https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/suppl/2011/01/05/bmj.c5347.DC1/deeb200710.ww1_default.pdf]

London. Michael Rutter, for the GMC, said in evidence to the fitness to practise panel that
there was “no evidence that I could identify” in the child’s examined records indicating 
any significant regressive element in his disorder''*


Gillian Baird's assessment of ''an impairment in respect of language'' given here, was ''at admission'', which indicates that it wasnt extensive and long running, and was an assessment that likely didn't involve much rigour. 

Michael Rutter's statement was based solely on the child's medical records, which were as we know, by admission of the GP's, incomplete and inaccurate!

In the GMC chargesheet [https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/gmc-charge-sheet.pdf], it states throughout, that in conduction of the study, a team of specialists re-analysed and updated previous assessments of the children's health.

The analysis of top autism specialists and gastroenterologists (at a good hospital) on autism & neurodevelopmental/gastroenterological matters, would be authority over the incomplete assessments of General Practioners that, themselves referred the children to the Royal Free Hospital.

To sum up or condense:

The explanation for these disparities, would be that, due to the novel nature of the situation (that MMR was causing autism, which would be a fairly new discovery if it were to be true), and the lack of prior knowledge of the link, the GP's would have had a hard time diagnosing the children's health condtions.

And therefore the specialist re-analysis would be a more accurate, and largely inconsistent assessment.

Therefore this would not be a case of data fabrication, but a case of re-analysis of incomplete medical records.

These findings support CDC’s recommendation that everyone should get both doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to get the most protection.

&#x200B;

In all seriousness though. . .this is serious.

&#x200B;

 It has been suggested that an increase in IgG4 levels could have a  protecting role by preventing immune over-activation, similar to that  occurring during successful allergen-specific immunotherapy by  inhibiting IgE-induced effects. However, emerging evidence suggests that  the reported increase in IgG4 levels detected after repeated  vaccination with the mRNA vaccines may not be a protective mechanism;  rather, it constitutes an immune tolerance mechanism to the spike  protein that could promote unopposed SARS-CoV2 infection and replication  by suppressing natural antiviral responses. Increased IgG4 synthesis  due to repeated mRNA vaccination with high antigen concentrations may  also cause autoimmune diseases, and promote cancer growth and autoimmune  myocarditis in susceptible individuals.

Have had what I believe to be COVID twice (tested positive once) and just didn't really worry too much. However, in September, a girl I went to high school with (I am 30) had tons of those white clots removed from her legs, her lungs, heart, etc., they were basically throughout her body. She miraculously survived and she said that her doctors believed with 98% confidence it was from a COVID infection. She posted this on her FB, along with photos of what they pulled out. 

Someone in the comment section asked, ""Covid, not vaccine?"" and the woman's mother responded by saying she never had a vaccine. So ever since then, I have just been freaking out. I am afraid to even exercise out of the fear of dying from the ""suddenly."" The only plausible explanations are:

1.) She did have a vaccine and someone is lying.

2.) Her husband got jabbed and has passed it along to her, STD style.

3.) She could have had a blood transfusion during her most recent childbirth last year, 2021, with contaminated blood.

4.) Vax shedding is legit and can cause the same outcomes in the unjabbed.

5.) COVID causes these heart issues/blood ""clots.""

Ugh. I am just so over all of this. It is difficult to imagine how we as a collective can ever see the other side of all of this. It is a fucking nightmare.

417,Going through this r/,"I do have to say the two sides of the whole vaccine debate are both very aggressive and very mean.

Here’s facts about myself:
1) I make vaccines for a living
2) I only have a B.S. in Microbiology with an emphasis in genetics.
3) there are people way more qualified to speak to this topic than myself.
4) I could care less if you get vaccinated, that is your prerogative. I myself will choose to get jabbed.

Here are facts
1) masks help in general to a certain extent. If you’re riding a bus in Seattle, a mask will probably give you more peace of mind than anything else. If you live in Republic WA, I see no need for masks because there’s like 5 people there. Masks help, but it is situational. Having extra protection never hurt though.

2) everyone has a different immune system. Some people will react differently. That is why we do studies to get a general idea of how a wide array of people react. Just because someone can run a 4 minute mile doesn’t mean everyone can. Just because someone felt sick after a vaccine doesn’t mean everyone will.

3) vaccines do not weaken your immune system, if you felt sick for a time after getting vaccinated, it’s probably cause you didn’t have a great immune system in the first place, or because you haven’t got sick in a while

4) CEOs of pharma companies are not super familiar with the science or manufacturing process. Their job is to run a business, not develop or manufacture. They’re smart in their own regards, but I wouldn’t take their word to heart.

5) vaccines help. As a country, the United States almost completely got rid of measles and polio. Measles came back because people who live in high density areas didn’t vaccinate. Polio can come back because an influx of poorly immunized people. Like when people take oral polio they can still shed live viral particles and they can infect others.

If you choose not to get vaccinated I don’t care, but do not tell doctors how to do their job. I don’t tell a diesel mechanic how to work on a truck.
On the flip side, if you’re vaccinated, don’t be a dick. You don’t know the other persons situation as to why they didn’t.

by Mere Keating

For those Who Doubt  the Plandemic Movie I researched some of the “I I ts” going around claiming to have “debunked” the movie, which are being regurgitated by many who prefer to remain asleep and won’t put the effort in to research things themselves. Here is what I found along with all of my supporting sources. 
1. Dr. Anthony Fauci has worked at the National Institute of Health (NIH) since 1968 and has been a Director with the organization since 1984, “both as a scientist and as the head of the NIAID at the NIH”. A simple Wikipedia search resolved that one. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Fauci

 2. The NIH was one of the institutions funding the original study published in 10/23/2009, which Dr. Mikovits participated in and makes reference to in the Plandemic movie. Dr. Fauci worked at and continues to work at the NIH, one of the primary financial contributors to the study as one of it’s most senior directors, so you can indeed say that Dr. Judy Mikovits was in fact working for Dr. Fauci. I have downloaded the complete original study and saved for you to access here (highlights on page 3 denote Dr. Judy Mikovits’s participation and her employing firm) (highlights on page 6 indicate the institutions which provided the funding for the study): https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MUVoBB_tL_e-opUws_FQwOfWupbgIj-K

 3. The study was challenged in 2010, when other researches could not replicate their findings and in September 2010, the original team, inclusive of Dr. Judy Mikovits issued an official response supporting their work. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1duM3FU-Tt60yGkSyqbskEFyrEa37W3nh 

4. After which the original study was partially and then subsequently fully retracted (a very rare move in science). The partial retraction document states that two of the co-authors, Robert Silverman and Das Gupta (whom the original study listed as working for the Department of Cancer Biology) re-analyzed the samples they used and discovered that they had been contaminated. Please refer back to the first link provided herein, for item #1 showing the original study, indicates on the document that it has since been retracted. 

5. That she was arrested and a quote from the prosecuting district attorney, that said the charges were dropped because ""there were issues with the witnesses"". https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/06/criminal-charges-dropped-against-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-researcher-judy-mikovits

431,Losing a Like-Minded Partner,"How do I get over breaking up with one of the only unjabbed guys I know left? This is already a devastating situation, and the prospects of meeting another unjabbed man who shares my convictions are even lower. I’m 22 and we dated for a year, we both felt strongly about mandates, read the EUA documents, etc. Most guys don’t even seem to care. When I find out a guy is jabbed, I literally lose all attraction for them.

I feel SO strongly I do not want this stuff in my body. I don’t want to be exposed to it in saliva either. I don't want to risk more heartbreak with health issues and compliance. It’s also a mindset and mentality - having different values. I fought so hard against this stuff and I want someone else who did not bend to the coercion. They are far and few in between.

What do I do. Please pray for me. I feel like I will die alone. I’m so sad over this loss, and the trauma we experienced fighting mandates the past year.

Not posting this to be cruel or take shots at the jabbed. We all make our own choices and I completely respect it. It's a preference. I lived by my convictions and I have felt so alone in every area of my life, I've lost my job, barely able to graduate college, etc. I'm so young and it's so hard to find people in the same boat as me. I feel isolated and hopeless. 

Please be kind.

Edit: For those asking for documents, I have the EUA’s originally posted by Pfizer and Moderna.

I printed them out when they came out. I highlighted and took notes.

I’ll see if I have a PDF version still.

My first baby was a COVID baby, born in May the year all this shit went down. I was already on leave, never really had to worry about isolating cause with a newborn you basically do that anyways. 

FF a year, went back to work basically remotely cause things were still up in the air. Vaccines came out.. everyone is freaking out, it's too new, it's not tried and true, this that and the other. I avoided getting it. I also went back to work pregnant. Woo! Now pregnant with my second, I have this fear of getting vaccinated while pregnant. My boss fought for me and others who were preggo, but no-go. It was mandatory or we go on leave without pay. Great. I go on sick leave again (for other personal reasons) and avoid the vaccine again. 

FF to now - my maternity leave is ending, we relocated during this pregnancy and I'm not returning to the same company. I cannot find a job in my field (for decent/same rate of pay) that won't accept me unvaccinated. 

My daughter is still breastfeeding and I was hoping to make it to a year (she's 10mo). I was presented with a FANTASTIC opportunity that would put me ahead in my field by ++ years and allow me to be my own boss (sort-of) -- must be min. double vaccinated. Great. I can't exactly say no to the money with the way things are in Onterrible right now (Ontario, Canada) and I need to start working sooner than later so waiting until her birthday isn't financially an option.

And both could lead to more severe symptoms, the authors wrote.

It’s seems crazy to me that I’m even thinking about this because covid is no threat to me and the vaccine doesn’t stop the spread. So I’m not effecting others.

444,Why the JAMA paper on vaccines in breast milk is a big nothing.,"In this paper, 11 lactating individuals received mRNA vaccines and had their expressed breastmilk (EBM) monitored for evidence of mRNA vaccines (6 Pfizer/BioNTech, 5 Moderna). The EBM was separated into fractions and an EV (extracellular vesicles) fraction was found to contain trace amounts of mRNA for up to 45 hours after vaccination in 5 of 11 individuals.

This finding isn't really new. In a minority of participants, prior work has found trace quantities of the Pfizer vaccine in breast milk: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8376902/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8376902/) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8787073/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8787073/)

Firstly, let's put these findings in perspective: the quantity of mRNA found in breast milk here is so tiny that it cannot reasonably do quite literally anything. At the highest concentrations found, it represented a dose equivalent to 0.667% of the original vaccine dose per 100 mL of milk and this is with a study that found a maximum concentration equivalent to \~120 times the highest concentration of mRNA found in this JAMA Pediatrics study.  Beyond that, there is a key bit of fundamental biochemistry at play.

mRNA, even the modified (to not provoke inflammation) mRNA used in the vaccines here, cannot tolerate the environment of the digestive tract. In fact, most vaccines cannot, and the only vaccines given by the oral route are for GI tract pathogens (polio, rotavirus).

That's because those pathogens have evolved to survive in the digestive tract, which is an environment containing regions of high acidity and is filled with enzymes that destroy proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and carbohydrates. Beyond that, no replication incompetent vaccine has ever been reported to cause adverse effects in the breastfeeding infant, and even then the only ones this is really relevant for are the replication-competent smallpox vaccines and yellow fever vaccine. The mRNA vaccines are not replication-competent.

Still, the only real question that matters is whether or not there is actual harm here.  What data do we have on the safety of vaccinee breastmilk in infants? This is reviewed well in the Lactmed page for the vaccines: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK565969/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK565969/)

But for some highlights:

[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778766](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778766) No evidence of harm to the infant from consuming vaccinee milk in this study where there were 47 lactating parents who received mRNA vaccines, but a few of the infants had upper respiratory infections.

In this study which included 53 infant-parent dyads, no serious adverse events were found to occur in children within 7 days of consuming the milk of vaccinees and any symptoms in infants in general were rare. However, there was no control group. [https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/P](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/P)

In a cohort study that included 10,278 lactating individuals who did not interrupt breastfeeding after vaccination, 121 of 10 278 (1.2%) reported any issues with their breast milk-fed infant after vaccination. [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2795998](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2795998)

In this study, 88 infant-parent pairs in Singapore were followed through vaccination wherein no adverse events (fever, rash, cough, behavioral change, vomiting, or diarrhea) were reported among infants who were breastfed after maternal vaccination. [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/08903344211056522?url\_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr\_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr\_dat=cr\_pub%20%200pubmed](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/08903344211056522?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed)

Still, if we speak of harms, we should speak of benefits. Whether or not breastmilk has a protective role in respiratory virus infections like COVID-19 is not entirely clear as there are ethical constraints on study design and exclusive breastfeeding status is subject to confounding; however, in one pre-vaccine study, exclusively formula fed children were more likely (OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.45, 3.51; P = 0.036) to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR compared with exclusively breastfed children. [https://internationalbreastfeedingjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13006-021-00430-z](https://internationalbreastfeedingjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13006-021-00430-z)

The breast milk of vaccinees is additionally enriched in factors known to be protective against SARS-CoV-2 including neutralizing antibodies and memory T cells. [https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8636305/](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8636305/)

Vaccination in pregnancy is also very important (I think probably more important than even during lactation) for protecting the infant: [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2793109](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2793109) [https://cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107e3.htm?s\_cid=mm7107e3\_w](https://cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107e3.htm?s_cid=mm7107e3_w)

In short, while the findings by Hanna et al are interesting, they're not particularly novel, nor concerning. The fact that it takes ultrasensitive assays to detect any mRNA in breast milk alone raises questions about the meaningfulness of the findings and they don't upend the significant body of literature showing that vaccination during lactation is safe.",xpdcr9,0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/xpdcr9/why_the_jama_paper_on_vaccines_in_breast_milk_is/

Also, has anyone heard that Ashkenazi  Jewish people are not affected by COVID?  As well as the old bloodlines of royalty - the Bluebloods are also not affected by COVID, apparently due to having no ACE-2 receptors or something?  The Chinese are also not harmed by COVID very badly, apparently, and perhaps they are working in collaboration on a massive genocide that is happening now before our very eyes?  Is there anyone reading this of Ashkenazi or Chinese descent that can comment on whether or not they have been harmed by COVID?  

Off topic, but I also heard that nicotine prevents people from getting COVID-19.  Not necessarily even smoking, but wearing a nicotine patch or chewing nicotine gum fills the receptors in the brain and block COVID from entering.  No wonder Fauci recently stated that no one should be smoking cigarettes anymore.

A recently published US surveillance study reported a preliminary signal of PE risk.  Studies like that one are subject to a lot of limitations.  The risk suggested was large enough to have been detected in the many high quality studies already performed throughout the world.

It should not surprise you to read that COVID infection itself is associated with large increases in risk of thromboembolic disease. The same study out of the UK found that COVID infection was associated with an 8x increased risk of venous thromboembolism. See purple bar below.

This is very similar to what happens to rape victims, who are systemically ignored, blamed and attacked for speaking out about what happened to them, to the point that the victims are scared to speak out.

It is also ironic that the left, who are typically the ones fighting for rape victims to be heard, is also the ones suppressing vaccine victims from speaking out. In effect the left is suppressing a minority.

And this goes much further, as untold people are now ""dying suddenly"" with no clear cause. It is quite obvious that at least some of these deaths must be vaccine related, but this is being completely ignored.

Again this reminds me of rape victims, it's said in the UK there's a systemic issue of young girls being abducted by certain groups of young men, and being gang raped for weeks on end, yet the victims and their parents can find no one to care about it because the police, government and media don't want to give it any attention.",11nhc3o,185,113,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/11nhc3o/vaccine_victims_are_being_shamed_for_speaking_out/

485,Isn't it weird how the pro-vaccine side gets super-aggressive about denying vaccine injuries whenever you bring up VAERS reports?,"Any time we bring up VAERS, they just go CRAZY! 

hey can't handle the truth, because the truth destroys their vaccine narratives.

they will insist that every VAERS report is an ""anecdote, correlation, coincidence, or temporal association"" 

and that even in the aggregate, VAERS data is just more GIGO (Garbage in, Garbage out).

they want us to think that every VAERS report is done by an anti-vaccine troll, 

for the purpose of...??? ... contaminating the VAERS database with garbage?

that sounds like something a pro-vaccine troll would do, doesn't it?

i mean, an anti-vaccine troll wouldn't make a VAERS report for ""Micky Mouse"" would he?

but a pro-vaccine person sure would, to try and discredit VAERS entirely! 

they want us to believe that VAERS reports are not followed-up on, not verified, 

and therefore VAERS reports are not credible sources to determine causality, even with aggregate data.

no, the only ""credible"" way to determine ""causality"", is for a pro-vaccine activist to do a ""study"", 

never mind that nobody in the entire history of the world has ever been able to use a ""vaccine study"" to find any long term vaccine problem,

and because nobody has ever been able to use any vaccine study, to find any vaccine problems, 

theres really no reason to expect anyone will ever be able to use a vaccine study to find a vaccine problem. 

and it is precisely because nobody has ever been able to use a vaccine study to find any vaccine problem, 

that it is considered ""evidence"" by pro-vaccine activists, that their ""vaccines are 100% safe... every one of them... from now until eternity""

nobody in the pro-vaccine activist world has ever asked the obvious question:

are ""vaccine studies even capable of finding vaccine problems?""

given that nobody has ever been able to demonstrate competence or proficiency doing that. 

just as an experiment, in the comments below, challenge the pro-vaccine side to explain away VAERS reports of high fever,

489,"To those ""There's absolutely no evidence vaccines cause autism"" people.","Well, there is no absolute solid evidence proving vaccines cause autism (because how are you going to, when it requires the cooperation of powerful agencies heavily dependent on the success of these vaccines to get funding to do large studies that would be able to provide more solid proof) but there's certainly evidence, and the evidence is respectable.

There's animal studies done by people like Zhibin Yao, and Lluis Lujan finding that there's links to the equivalent of autism in vaccinated sheep and humanised mice.

There's biopsies done by James Lyons Weiller and Chris Exely that found autism to be associated with aluminium presence in brain tissue.

There's dozens of studies linking the gastrointestinal issues that arise from certain diseases with autism, on top of the original 1998 Lancet study (even if you attack this one, there's at least 5 others proving the same thing!). (Some vaccines contain live viruses that cause these diseases, like measles).

There's small unvaxxed vaxxed studies done by Paul Thomas and Brian S Hooker showing autism is more common in vaccinated kids.

There's CDC whistleblower Dr William Thompson saying that autism links were covered up in the CDC study he conducted.

There's Andrew Zimmerman who determined that Hannah Poling actually got autism from her vaccines, in a legal case that ended up winning for a million dollars, and is one of the only cases in history of a successful autism vaccine lawsuit, proving that it's incredibly hard to actually succeed at that, meaning that there must have been some good evidence.

There's thousands of parents around the world sharing stories that are all consistent, who could have not known about eachothers situations, showing that this likely comes from authentic places of real experience. In these stories there's always a perfectly normal behaving child or children, then there's a vaccine, and then shortly after a serious decline of behaviour and social development leading to autism diagnoses. In at least one of these cases that I recall, it happened to both brother and sister in separate instances, making the chances of coincidence far smaller.

There's Somali communities that have the highest rate of autism in the USA that also happen to be heavily vaccinated when they migrate.

And there's head director of the CDC saying that vaccines cause autism like symptoms, and there's world renowned vaccinologist Dr Stanley Plotkin who under legal deposition stated that studies done on DTP looking at autism were not able to prove or disprove an association despite being presented as though they do.

And there's Dr Paul Offit, another world renowned vaccinologist who said once on camera that ""We cannot truly say vaccines do not cause autism, but we cannot leave that door open, so we have to get used to saying it.""

There's small studies from Paul Thomas and Brian hooker showing autism is more common in vaccinated.

There's CDC whistleblower Dr William Thompson saying that autism links in black males were covered up by him and his team in the CDC study he conducted in 2004.

There's a the fact that only one vaccine has been studied for autism links in any real detail and theres 15 others left out, which makes one who has a rational sound epistemology suspicious.",va2w9n,14,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/va2w9n/to_those_theres_absolutely_no_evidence_vaccines/

A very significant portion of this humanity, are psychotic, hopelessly lost, negligent or criminal, and incapable of performing any rational judgements or assessments of these developments. The 'mass formation psychosis' is very real; and it is this psychosis, which is the driver, and the energetic supply for the mass murder which is now sweeping the globe.

I recently watched a documentary about the HPV vaccines. In summary; Innocent young women are told that there is a virus, which will give them cancer, if they get it. They are offered a vaccine, which will protect them. They take it. But the vaccine has no innoculative propery; there is no virus that can give them cancer, and the vaccine, rather than being merely saline that has been sold to them on a lie - has been trialled and precisely designed to destroy a portion of these young women by the tuned toxic effect.

This HPV vaccine model has been exported to the entire planet in the Covid - 19 marketing campaign. We have not merely been conned into paying for a harmless shot that we do not need. We have purchased death; or rather mega death, or perhaps even giga death? Time will tell.

Every day for these last two years, I have tried to grasp what it is that separates or defines the two groups - the willing victims of the slaughter, and the ones who desire to survive uncontaminated by the murdering hand of the vaccines.

511,Tips for finding “vaccine flexible” pediatrician,"The last two years have made me question a lot of things I never would have prior.  

My young son has received most of his routine vaccinations (on a somewhat delayed/spaced out schedule), and obviously will NOT be getting any of the mRNA shots, but after reading and doing more research (the book Vaccines 2.0 by Mark Blaxill and Dan Olmsted is very informative and nuanced- not totally anti vax), I don’t want my son receiving every remaining vaccine on the CDC schedule, although I’m okay with some of them.  

I suspect our current pediatrician may go so far as to “fire” us from their practice if we don’t comply as they made it clear they are a “fully vaccinating” clinic.  They were at least willing to delay and space out a number of my son’s shots.

It is claimed  that viruses cause disease after transmitting between hosts such as humans and yet the scientific  evidence for these claims is missing.

In order to  obfuscate this state of affairs, virologists have resorted to creating their own pseudoscientific methods to  replace the longstanding scientific method, as well as changing the dictionary meaning of words in order  to support their anti-scientific practices. For instance, an “isolated” isolate does not require the physical  existence of the particles in order to be afforded “isolation” status.*

More than half of respondents who were prepared to say if or not they had been vaccine injured - said that they were indeed vaccine injured.

A question I have regarding this result is; Would we have such a seemingly large number/proportion of vaccine injured respondents - if this poll had been done prior to the Covid - 19 vaccine roll-out?

A further question is; Does this poll result represent the outcome of a safe and effective vaccine/s schedule as recommended by our governments? 

Or on the other hand; Does this poll result have no significance or meaning in relation to the question of if or not our vaccine schedule is 'safe and effective'?

Why were so many respondents in this poll not prepared to say either way if they feel they were injured or not?

557,The Newborns Are Not Alright: Billions Of Babies Will Inherit Spike Protein Genes,"Many people that have tragically subjected themselves to the DEATHVAX™ often claim that they feel “fine” and falsely believe that they are “protected” and that “it could have been worse” when they all invariably do acquire COVID, more at VAIDS symptoms.

These claims are akin to getting exposed to deadly radiation or walking around with undiagnosed late stage cancer and having little reason to believe that life is anything but normal.

As per a recent Swedish research paper on reverse transcriptas showed that in liver cells the RNA is transcribed into DNA and **integrated into the human genome,** we can now sadly confirm that billions of babies born to those parents that have been exposed to the slow kill bioweapon injections have inherited the spike protein genes.

The study showed that the Modified mRNa tends to concentrate in the ovaries and spleen. Reverse transriptase is found in these organs. **This means that billions of the new generation will die extremely cruel deaths.**

>**Abstract**Preclinical studies of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2, developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, showed reversible hepatic effects in animals that received the BNT162b2 injection. Furthermore, a recent study showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the genome of human cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of BNT162b2 on the human liver cell line Huh7 in vitro. Huh7 cells were exposed to BNT162b2, and quantitative PCR was performed on RNA extracted from the cells. We detected high levels of BNT162b2 in Huh7 cells and changes in gene expression of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1), which is an endogenous reverse transcriptase. Immunohistochemistry using antibody binding to LINE-1 open reading frame-1 RNA-binding protein (ORFp1) on Huh7 cells treated with BNT162b2 indicated increased nucleus distribution of LINE-1. PCR on genomic DNA of Huh7 cells exposed to BNT162b2 amplified the DNA sequence unique to BNT162b2. Our results indicate a fast up-take of BNT162b2 into human liver cell line Huh7, leading to changes in LINE-1 expression and distribution. We also show that BNT162b2 mRNA is reverse transcribed intracellularly into DNA in as fast as 6 h upon BNT162b2 exposure.

The criminal MSM along with their partners in crime BigPharma, the Center for Disease Crimes (CDC), FDA, et al. guaranteed that these experimental gene therapies would not and could not alter DNA in any way. The all ***knowingly*** lied; to wit:

>**Conclusions**Our study is the first in vitro study on the effect of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 on human liver cell line. We present evidence on fast entry of BNT162b2 into the cells and subsequent intracellular reverse transcription of BNT162b2 mRNA into DNA.[Source](https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/44/3/73/htm).

559,"I think we ought to really get used to saying ''we don't really know'' when it comes to harms, not just 'benefits' from covid vaccines. It's tempting to put numbers on it because we want to think we have knowledge, but the harsh truth is, no one really knows, NONE of the numbers can be relied upon.","I'm really totally sick of hearing people like Malhotra putting out numbers like 1/800 as if they're even remotely reliable.  


I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm saying we JUST don't KNOW.   


And that's the whole issue. The issue isn't ''we know how many died or got injured and that's bad''.  


It's ''We don't know, and there's reasons to believe it's a large amount, and it's clear that the research just isn't there to tell us what the risk benefit ratio really is, and that's very very problematic, because not knowing is worse than knowing, even if it turns out it's only 6,000 Americans that died from the vaccine or something. Going blindfolded into a mass vaccination program IS the problem.   


The Lack of DATA is the problem.   


Sure, you can talk about these figures like ''1/800'' and ''1/200'' and ''1/10'000'' but don't pretend they're even remotely reliable.   


Let's take Joseph Fraimen's study in which he suggested that the rate of Serious adverse events was 1/800. Well, there's massive issues here. Firstly this is over 2 months, secondly, this is not a rate.   


1/800 is the ratio between number of people and number of adverse events reported.   


Not the rate of people who got severe adverse events.   


Why? Because some people got more than ONE severe adverse event. So that could count to that 1/800 figure in a misleading way.   


I cannot believe people like Malhotra/bigtree/mccullough won't acknowledge this or see this, it's soo frustrating that they haven't read the small print, we cannot afford to be clumsy with the information, it gives people a reason to discredit us. I've seen pro vaxxers, rightly, attack people for this misinformation. 

Also... When it comes to studies on masks and lockdowns.. Don't think for a minute that a mainstream publication would literally publish a study that's damning for masks and lockdowns or vaccinal immunity vs natural immunity. The Cochrane Review on masks did not prove masks were ineffective, we just jumped onto it out of desperation. Only two or three of the something like 30 papers reviewed on masks in that meta-analysis actually revolved around covid19 at all.. The rest were all FLu studies, and the covid19 papers actually DID suggest a benefit from mask wearing.   


Now I am not saying I think the paper is accurate, I'm saying that we cannot trust anything, none of the data is reliable, and we must be cynical when a mainstream source publishes anti establishment narratives that I'm sure are probably just there as damage limitation to get people to believe that they're admitting the truth.

[mRNA vaccine-induced antibodies more effective than natural immunity in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 and its high affinity variants](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06629-2)

This paper was funded by federal grant HHSN261200800001E - this is clearly stated in the paper under the ""Funding"" section. Here is a link to that grant -

[HHSN261200800001E - USAspending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_HHSN261200800001E_7529_-NONE-_-NONE-)

Contract HHSN261200800001E was originally awarded in 2008 to SAIC for cancer research. Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) is an American technology company headquartered in Reston, Virginia that provides government services and information technology support. Today the company goes by the name Leidos and has merged with Lockheed Martin's IT sector, Information Systems & Global Solutions, to create the defense industry’s largest IT services provider.

The federal contract awarded to SAIC is an open checkbook kind of deal that is capped at something like $80 billion. This contract was originally awarded to fund a bioinformatics software system for cancer research. That project cost the taxpayers $350 million and was so poorly executed that after completion, it was scrapped and the NIH approved a new version of the same damn project, again to SAIC.

And that same contract was used to fund this bogus study. The ""science"" in this paper is absolutely laughable.

584,Vaccines really do cause Autism Here's the proof.,". . . “The elementary grades are overwhelmed with children who have symptoms of neurological or immune-system damage,” Patti White, a school nurse, told the House Government Reform Committee in 1999. “Vaccines are supposed to be making us healthier; however, in 25 years of nursing I have never seen so many damaged, sick kids. Something very, very wrong is happening to our children.” More than 500,000 kids currently suffer from autism, and pediatricians diagnose more than 40,000 new cases every year. The disease was unknown until 1943, when it was identified and diagnosed among 11 children born in the months after thimerosal was first added to baby vaccines in 1931. . .

Have you ever wondered what information Government uses to make its decisions? Is there an issue where you don’t think politicians are using the best available evidence? 

Evidence Week in Parliament is opened by people like you asking their MP about the evidence behind issues you’re passionate about, such as vaccines. We do it live and online so you get an immediate answer from government advisers and experts, as well as your local MP. 

You decide the topics under discussion, and you can ask about anything – we’ve had questions on energy, housing, pensions, transport and healthcare policymaking, parliamentary process and even allotment planning. The only restriction is that you should ask your MP to look at the evidence, not just tell them what you think they should do. 

**Email your MP now** to ask your question at the online launch at 5pm on Monday 3 July: [https://senseaboutscience.org/evidence-week/ask-for-evidence/](https://senseaboutscience.org/evidence-week/ask-for-evidence/) 

We want as many people as possible to get the answers they deserve, so please spread the word by sharing this message, e.g. by [tweeting](https://clicktotweet.com/aHcbD) about it.  

If you have any questions you can message me, Annie – I’m the Communities officer at Sense about Science, a charity that champions the public interest in evidence.

I tried to look up the ingredients, and found a for-publication summary of the ingredients of the Moderna vaccine.  It read that the vaccine uses ""lipid nanoparticles"" to bypass human cell walls, and unloads the virus RNA fragment, and reprograms human cells to produce virus proteins.  I would like to spend some more time researching this method.

621,"Genuine question: Aren't the unvaccinated the only ones who can say, authentically, they have ""long-covid""?"," Posted this over in the place that shall not be named but also posting here to try to see the differing sides of the debate. 

So I genuinely want to start an honest conversation around this, hopefully at this point we can rise above the petty tribalism of this side vs that side and just look at the facts and the science around this, hopefully even with some dignity and mutual respect for one another although maybe I'm being a little ambitious there...

TL;DR - Logically, only the unvaccinated can fairly say they are suffering from long covid. If you've been vaccinated, your ongoing ""long-covid"" symptoms can't be unattributed to the possibility the vaccine played a role.

I fully acknowledge that there may be information or research that I have missed or am not aware of, so please if that's the case I'd love to hear your thoughts and share away. Links if possible, and let's try and stay away from unreliable sources. No far right nonsense. Let's see if we can approach this objectively and in good faith.

""Long covid"" is one of the 'scary-unknown' elements of this pandemic that have been new to most of us, and I think there's not a huge about of information out there on it, which adds to that mysteriousness of it. Part of why I'm doing this post is that I hope to learn more about it, so I'm looking forward to what people will share.

On the one end, the far-right conspiracy theory mob think that long-covid is a sham, a hoax, and not even a real thing. On the other end are the triple-maskers early-boosters who are terrified to go near another human out of fear of a perceived never-ending life-sentence of coughing, fatigue and eventual death, however many years it may be down the road.

Let's be clear... both those people are ridiculous. In between those extremes though, there's a massive spectrum of differing ideas and opinions that exist.

But outside of those differing ideas and opinions, is the objective reality. The facts. The undeniable reality of what is actually happening.

If you define long-covid as the ongoing residual symptoms caused by covid alone and nothing else, then it becomes very clear that there's some real problems here.

My postulation is this: the only group who can genuinely say they are suffering from long covid - that was only caused by covid - are the unvaccinated.

I don't see how there's logical, authentic, scientific way any vaccinated person can say they are suffering from long-covid, and not at least investigate the possibility the vaccines could be playing a role in their ongoing symptoms.

They may well have gotten covid, and are now having ongoing symptoms, perhaps similar or even identical to people with long-covid who are unvaccinated, maybe less bad, maybe worse... but they've also been vaccinated, maybe twice, maybe three or four times. And that spike protein is playing a much bigger role in their biochemistry, its been there for longer, it's ""triggering that immune response"" as the [literal Dictionary definition of a vaccine states](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vaccine). And please, maybe this is an area I'm uninformed in, so if anyone can share anything peer-reviewed and reliable on the topic I'd be very interested to read it.

Here's an [ABC Article](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-06-24/long-covid-nsw-research-five-per-cent-of-patients-slow-recovery/100241420) about a University of NSW study that followed 3,000 people with covid and found that 80% had no symptoms after 1 month, 95% had no symptoms after 3 months. So long covid in this sense, lasting longer than 3 months, is only found in less than 5% of people, and they mainly had significant respiratory problems before or didn't get any early treatment. The full study is lined in the article from memory.

So surely, if someone who has been single, double, triple or quad-jabbed has symptoms akin to ""long-covid"" as it is called, or any residual illness for that matter, shouldn't we be investigating the role the spike protein is playing in being in people so much? Can we see any studies done looking into the relationship or impact of these vaccines on ""long-covid""? Do they decrease the rates of long-covid compared to the unvaccinated? What investigation has been done into the duration comparing these two groups?

And also, just to address the elephant in the room, if you have had two, three, four injections of a drug to stop you getting a thing, but then you still get the thing, and you still get the worst parts and the long term residual effects of the thing, then maybe that drug... was shit. And that's ok! That's not your fault. You approached it in good faith, you tried to do the right thing, there's no shame in that. But at a certain point we've got to just accept things for what they are, don't we?

And for the record, I'm not an ""anti-vaxxer"" or a right-wing nutjob. I'm an emergency services worker, a father of two. I've had all the usual vaccines. I've had vaccines to get into certain countries, Dengue, Yellow Fever... But I just found these covid ones in particular questionable, there were a lot of things that were very off so I thought I'd wait. The way the media was all banging the exact same drum. The highly problematic safety studies. The complete ethical violations as to their role out. Then I saw a lot of friends and family get injured. My uncle had a stroke after his 2nd Pfizer. My friend collapsed at work, twice. He knows 5 people who ended up in hospital. My other friend lost their dad, blood clots in the lungs, 7 days after his 2nd AZ. That same friend's baby ended up in hospital, doctors confirmed it the vaccine passed through the mothers breast milk and gave the baby ITP. I also knew plenty of people who had them and were fine. So I waited. Then I saw all my vaccinated friends and family getting covid anyway. My triple jabbed dad, in his 80s, with health problems, so high risk, got covid from my triple jabbed other uncle. Both had it pretty bad.

Anyway I still don't know if I'm right or wrong, I'm just trying to figure this all out, and hope the discussion around this issue can help me make sense of all this.

638,Finally got COVID-19,"TLDR Covid fucked the end of my vacation. More than 8 of us got sick regardless of vax status. Gave me brain zaps panic attacks and depression. It’s been over 2 weeks slowly healing.  


Here’s my story. Single Pfizer vax last year in august. Had lots of side effects. Arm tingling.  Jab site pain to this day. It’s like my arm was permanently bruised. Mild chest pains. So I didn’t go back for the second…. Obviously, and nobody in my family got any jabs. Have a wife and 3 kids. 

Took 2 weeks off to take a long vacation to Hilton head for my 40th bday, and had lots of family come in. It was epic. Hadn’t seen my oldest brother in 13 years. Literally had the best days of my life. 

2 days before leaving my 7 year old came down with the… I’m sick. He’s a chubby kid and loves to eat. He wasn’t eating. That’s how I know it serious. I had a very mild sore throat the night before that but didn’t think much of it. My wife also felt a little off. 

Took a Covid test and had a bright line and a very faint positive. It was so faint I really wasn’t 100% I was positive but now I know. That night after my son wouldn’t eat he woke up throwing up all over the place. Poor guy. My wife also was the king up a lot. My mother was also sick and her sore throat was really bad. 

We left the next morning and I was feeling pretty shitty. Mainly a sore throat. I had no choice but to head back home so that’s what we did. 

On the drive home I was having brain zaps. If you’ve ever been on any kind of SSRI antidepressant and stopped taking it it’s likely you know what I’m talking about. Well that’s what I was having. I thought to myself that this is fucking weird as fuck. Why am I having these? I wasn’t on any medication that would cause this. I had the zaps for 2 whole days. 

So we make it home after an 8 hour drive and 3 out of the 5 of us test positive again. We already knew but wanted to verify if my oldest son had it because he was about to head off to college. 

We all rest and isolate. Day 3 my symptoms are manageable but not fun lol. My throat was very very sore and coughing was scary because it was like a fire ball in my throat and chest.

Day 4 was the worst day yet and I started feeling anxious. I would pace around and feel like I was just so restless but it would go away. 

Day 5 I woke up at 7:30 am and immediately went outside super anxious. I coughed a few times really hard and it sent that fireball through my chest and my adrenaline spike so fast and it sent me into the worst panic attack of my life. It went on for 15 min. That entire day I was in another dimension mentally like I’ve never experienced. My doc gave me some meds to put me to sleep and I almost had 2-3 more panic attacks that day. 

Day 6 I was supposed to return to work… called off… and I was just depressed as fuck. At this point I realize Covid is the reason for these mental symptoms and I just didn’t know that’s what was up. 

I’ve had a ride of mental issues for the last few weeks. Slowly healing. I’ve read a lot about it and was unaware. So beware. It doesn’t do everyone like this. I’ve had a migraine with an aura….. only experiencing this one other time in my life. Fatigue and my mind is just cloudy at the end of the day sometimes. 

So out of the 15 people on the vacation 8 got COVID-19. The virus didn’t care who was vaccinated. My mom got it the worst and she was double boosted. I had that one jab and it tore me up mentally. My brother was vaccinated and also had some mental issues.

642,Where now?,"When I found this sub, I quickly saw that it is a great source for links to information regarding how the global clinical trial of the Covid - 19 vaccines is progressing. It seemed a straighforward process of information gathering that one engaged in, and so one proceeded in that engagement, to develop a progressing sense of the unfolding human disaster. 

But this is a 'debate' forum and so we ought to try to develop a consensus regarding where we are now in terms of debate in regards of what we can fairly say has been satisfactorily established thus far in relation to the Covid - 19 vaccines such that we can progress into debating the most pertinent matters in relation to the unfolding vaccine catastrophe.

My sense at this time is that - it is incontrovertably (for reasonable and for practical purposes) established here that the Covid - 19 vaccines are NOT safe and effective. It is obvious that one might (as some still do) ask for 'ESP' - 'evidence, source, proof' for anything and for everything and forever - but this nevertheless cannot cause one to doubt the established truth of the disaster. Rather it suggests at this time that some will remain permanently insensible or oblivious to human suffering and be capable of the most insensitive, unselfconscious and callous remarks; as I have recently seem commented to people who have reported here the loss of loved ones due to the vaccines.

659,"Vaccines CAN cause mild to severe neurological damage that in some cases leads to autistic like behaviour and that's why vaccines 'cause' ""autism"".","As a disclaimer, I don't believe vaccines cause autism because there's no serious evidence, but I do believe that there's an effort to avoid finding out out of fear. Here's why I think:

Autism is just a set of developmental behaviours in a person. 

You can't actually distinguish between causes. There's no brain scan used to prove someone has autism or the cause.

It's all just educated guesswork by doctors by looking at a set of behaviour. 

Therefore anything that leads to that behaviour is considered autism.

Vaccines can cause neurological problems and these problems appear to be very autistic in nature. They include symptoms autism is well known for. 

So maybe the vaccines causing autism debate is not useful because autism isn't as etiologically defined as people think.

Do vaccines cause neurological problems? Absolutely. 

Do vaccines cause neurological problems in young developing children that lead to automatic introverted behavioural problems that appear as autism appears when it's just genetic? 

Autism means - Automatic Self. Auto-Ism.

Vaccines cause autism like behaviour and even the head of the CDC admitted this in 2009. (Julie Gerberding).",v75o2h,57,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/v75o2h/vaccines_can_cause_mild_to_severe_neurological/

No one can deny that. Even if just by 0.1%. What we do has consequences on others and our own health and therefore our chances of dying of things, and some of those things can even cause us to die or increase our chances or do harm.

I don't think anyone can deny , some things we did made the impact of covid worse and some things we did made the impact smaller, at least on some small level, and some level of external harm (suicides for example) was caused by things we did and some level of external harm was reduced by things we did (less car crashes, less traffic).

So if what we did impacted the outcome of the virus we will never be able to work out the exact amount that was due to our own doing.

And so how can we really even make a cost benefit analysis with the vaccine if we don't know the true, pure, deadliness of the virus, or lack thereof?

673,Twisting statistics to serve a narrative,"We keep hearing how ""vaccine may cause x, but it is a trillion times more common with infection, therefore vaccines should be administered to everyone on earth"". This is a bizarre, anti-mathematical, anti-logical, anti-scientific statement that the ""experts"" are making.

First of all, vaccines and infection are not mutually exclusive, simply because vaccines don't prevent infection. So even if vaccines had a 1% chance of causing x adverse effect, and infection had 5%, that means overall risk for that adverse effect would be high with vaccine + infection as opposed to infection alone. This is elementary math. Yet the ""experts"" either don't understand it, or are deliberately twisting things to fit the non-scientific, political agenda they are being paid to promote.

The only benefit of the vaccine that there is evidence for is reduction of risk of severe acute respiratory covid. It does not protect against long covid (except the type of long covid that arises from severe acute covid itself, for obvious reasons, more on this below). It is associated with many of the same adverse long term effects that infection causes. Therefore, logically, the only factor to decide when determining the risk/benefit analysis of ""to vaccinate or not"" is ""does the protection against severe acute respiratory covid for this given individual OFFSET the potential long term/permanent adverse effects associated with vaccination"". Obviously, this should be done on an individual basis, as everybody's risk for severe acute respiratory covid is different.

For example, perhaps a 70 year old with risk factors might pass this risk/benefit analysis, because they have a relatively high risk of severe acute respiratory covid, which could kill them or put them on a ventilator, so for them, it might be worth it to get the vaccine. However, can we say the same thing about a healthy 12 year old, who has a 0.01% chance of severe acute respiratory covid without vaccination? This is why there is something called informed consent, which means the patient has to understand the risks/benefits involved, and make their own choice. Was this demonstrated during the pandemic? All I saw was the ""experts"" rabidly encouraging virtually every single human on earth to get not just vaccinate but get boosted, and even deny natural immunity, for a long time.

Let's see what the experts say on vaccination and long covid:

>Evidence suggests that receiving two 2 or more vaccine doses before  infection helps to reduce the risk of developing post COVID-19  condition.

[https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms/post-covid-19-condition.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms/post-covid-19-condition.html)

Let's use basic math and logic to examine how much practical utility making this blanket statement to the public has.

There are 4 generally agreed upon different causes of long covid:

\- severe acute respiratory covid itself (vaccines protect against this)

\- autoimmune issues (there is no evidence that vaccines protect against this, and no reason to believe so by now)

\- persistent viral load (no established evidence vaccines protect against this, though a small % of people with long covid claim getting vaccinated reduced their long covid symptoms, which implies perhaps the vaccine may help with this, but again, this cause constitutes a rather small % of long covid patients)

\- inflammation/clotting from the spike protein (no evidence vaccines protect against this, no reason to believe so, in fact vaccine injured individual have the same symptoms as long covid patients, and the vaccines also contain the spike protein, so use some basic inferential logic here...)

Now, obviously, if you don't get severe acute covid in the first place, you can't get long covid from the mechanism/cause called ""severe acute covid"". However, the vaccine appears to be largely ineffective against the other causes of long covid, and practically does not prevent infection. So using basic math and logic, IF you are at high risk of getting severe covid, then yes, vaccination would be a way to reduce your chances of long covid, and this statement """" Evidence suggests that receiving two 2 or more vaccine doses before  infection helps to reduce the risk of developing post COVID-19  condition. "" would make sense to you.

But WHAT % of the population is at risk of severe acute covid in the first place? A very small %.. therefore, using basic logic and math, that must mean that the vast majority of people who get long covid get it from a cause OTHER than ""severe acute covid"" and instead one of the other 3 causes, which vaccines are largely ineffective at combating. Practically, less than 5% of people under 65 without risk factors for severe acute covid will get severe acute covid. So something like 90%+ of the overall population will not get severe acute covid without vaccination, and all these people, if they get long covid, it will be from a cause/mechanism that vaccines are largely or completely ineffective against (and in fact may cause themselves, especially the spike protein mechanism/cause). So again, how much practical utility is there to make this blanket statement to the public in order to motivate them to vaccinate: "" Evidence suggests that receiving two 2 or more vaccine doses before  infection helps to reduce the risk of developing post COVID-19  condition. ""

There is more. For example, both vaccines and infection are known to be able to cause the disease POTS. However, of course, we get the standard ""but infection causes 20 gazillion times higher rates, THEREFORE, you SHOULD vaccinate"". Again, firstly, vaccine and infection are not mutually exclusive in terms of such risks, due to basic logic (if they can both cause it) so it makes no logical sense to say you should vaccinate BECAUSE the risk from vaccine is lower. Secondly, according to basic logic, they either neglected basic/elementary basic research methods and statistics, or they deliberately twisted the study to serve the political agenda/narrative:

[https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2022/researchers-study-links-between-covid-and-pots](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2022/researchers-study-links-between-covid-and-pots)

>As researchers study links between COVID-19  vaccines and uncommon side effects, they have found a slight increase in  the number of people who have experienced [postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/postural-tachycardia-syndrome)  (POTS) following vaccination. However, this association is five times  less common compared to people who developed POTS after having COVID.  The findings from this study, which was partially supported by NHLBI,  published in [*Nature Cardiovascular Research*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00177-8)[ external link ](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2022/researchers-study-links-between-covid-and-pots#).

Bizarrely, one of the authors of this study said the following:

>The main message here is that while we see a  potential link between COVID-19 vaccination and POTS, preventing  COVID-19 through vaccination is still the best way to reduce your risk  of developing POTS,” said study author Alan C. Kwan, M.D., through a  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center news release.

Now, there is no way this researcher is that stupid to believe that: it is common knowledge that vaccination in practice does not prevent infection (unless you were to get boosted every 3 months for life, even then you would still have to mask and such, as the limited protection from vaccines is far from 100% even within those first few months after vaccination). But don't you find it bizarre that this author, and every other author of a study that shows some adverse effect of the vaccine HAS to say this despite not believing it? Obviously, they know that if they don't, their study won't get published in the first place/they will be blacklisted/it will damage their career. So who are we trying to fool here? Even the CDC admits vaccines are poor at preventing infection at this point. So to me, this just shows how much censorship is prevalent these days for these authors to have to say this just to get their studies published.

[https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/27/politics/cdc-mask-guidance/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/27/politics/cdc-mask-guidance/index.html)

>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday changed its  masking recommendations as it grows more concerned over the Delta  variant of Covid-19, urging [vaccinated people in certain areas of the country ](https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/25/politics/anthony-fauci-covid-19-unvaccinated-cnntv/index.html)to resume wearing masks indoors in public areas....  
>  
>New evidence found that the levels of virus found in breakthrough cases  among the vaccinated people are similar to those found in unvaccinated  individuals who contract coronavirus, raising concerns that vaccinated  individuals may be able to spread the virus, the official said.

\^This logically implies the CDC is saying vaccination is not sufficient to protect against infection. Keep in mind this was for Delta, in 2021, we are now in 2023, and omicron is far more contagious/vaccines are even less effective at preventing infection. So why do author's need to say these bizarre follow up statements? Doesn't that prove my point?

This medical doctor (who was initially blindly pro vaccine, and then as more evidence came in, he started to accept that an individual/cost benefit analysis needed to be done), used statisticians and PhDs to analyze this study and shows that bizarrely, in the above study that they claimed POTS is 5 times less common in vaccination compared to infection, they did not control for baseline characteristics between the vaccine and covid groups. That is, the covid group had higher rates of POTS to BEGIN with. After adjusting for this, it appears that no, vaccination was not ""5 times"" less likely to cause POTS, rather, a measly 15%.

So my question to those ""experts"" and those in charge, who continue to do these things, do you think this is conducive to increasing public trust? Do you think next pandemic people will trust you more or less? You claim you are pro-vaccine, but because of these things you do, we now unfortunately have people even questioning whether to take vaccines for severe disease such as tetanus, which is very unfortunate and sad. Do you think you are helping humanity by doing these things? Have you read the boy who cried wolf? Don't you think the truth always comes out in the end? So is it better to be honest or dig our heads in the sand and continuously tell people ""vaccines are absolutely infallible and every single human on earth regardless of individual risk/benefit analysis must get vaccinated and boosted and anybody who brings up ANY DEGREE of constructive criticism based on legitimate scientific or logical or mathematical concerns shall be censored on the basis of spreading misinformation?"" Do you think this increases or decreases public trust? If you have no evidence to prove wrong someone who brings up constructive criticism, and randomly claim that they are spreading misinformation, when you have no evidence to prove your own point, and no evidence to prove them wrong, and automatically censor them, that is pure dictatorship, is it not?",13ftl29,31,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/13ftl29/twisting_statistics_to_serve_a_narrative/

690,My Thoughts on Vaccine Safety,"First off, let me say that I am pro-vaccine. I have received every vaccine recommended to me including Covid-19 (+ booster) and yearly flu shots. It’s hard to think of an invention that has had a more positive impact on humanity than vaccines. What got me interested in this topic was reading some research showing that prevalence of autism was significantly *lower* in kids that were vaccinated (MMR) than un-vaccinated. But if there is no connection between vaccines and autism, shouldn’t the prevalence be the same? Why the difference?

We know that vaccines elicit an immune response, though it is a milder response than getting the actual disease. We also know that if the immune system mistakenly thinks that “self” looks similar enough to the antigen it is responding to it can cause autoimmune disease. This is why autoimmune diseases often appear after an infection. So, here’s my thought, and just hear me out here with an open mind. What if the immune reaction caused by vaccines can in rare cases cause autism & other autoimmune side effects, but they can also *protect* against these same conditions by preventing the disease that the vaccine is for. The best analogy I can think of is airbags. In rare cases they can cause injury, though overall they are protective. Of course, in the case of airbags this fact is acknowledged which has led to improvements in safety. The problem is that the vaccine issue is so polarized that it’s blasphemy to even suggest that in rare cases a vaccine might cause an issue, even if overall they are protective. I think if people weren’t so dogmatic in their beliefs maybe there could be some rational debate about this. It might even lead to more people getting vaccinated if further research showed that autism could be triggered by a disease that a vaccine could prevent.

I’ll also just add that I don’t think mercury or any other ingredient in vaccines cause any issues and that this idea is just a red herring. If anything (and I’m not saying this is necessarily true just saying maybe), side effects are probably caused by the immune system itself. I also don’t think the immune system is the only cause of autism. Like cancer, there is likely a complicated combination of genetics and environmental factors and in both cases these include the immune system.

So here's the update:

Colleague was back at the office again today and seemed very well.

I asked him what the vaccine was again that he got so I could then (half-jokingly) say that it's apparently a really good vaccine as he still seems so well.

But when I asked he said: ""I didn't get it.""

Me: ""So did I succeed in talking you out of it?""

Him: ""No. It was cancelled. When I called shortly before they told me that since I already had an mRNA-vaccine before, I'm not eligible to get this one.""

Me: ""But you didn't want another Pfizer-shot?""

Him: ""Right. And I would have to go to <city about 50 km from here> to get it.""

So at least he doesn't want another Pfizer shot.  
What's interesting about that is that they told him that he must not mix Novavax with Pfizer. Anyone heard about that before and has an idea why?  
I just asked him if they told him. He said: ""They said it would not be good for the patient. I don't believe it. I think it's just lobbying by Pfizer. Same as how they didn't let me get another shot of Astra Zeneca.""

What is also interesting is that they told him to actually get another Pfizer-shot he'd have to go to another city. That's also weird. I didn't think that stuff would be so rare that they don't have it here.

But I could speculate about the whole ordeal. Maybe they feel that something is off about these vaccines and they don't want to administer any more shots to avoid the associated guilt. So they come up with reasons not to do it without telling the patient directly as to not lose their license.",wqjp6h,62,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/wqjp6h/interesting_development_in_the_case_of_talking_my/

This 'paper' contains several **fallacious scientific assumptions leading to misunderstandings and thus invalidating the conclusions**.

Analysis of the provided bibliography indicates **profound misinterpretations of topics and conclusions** about the negative impact that vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 could have on immunity.

Firstly, the authors claim that they will provide ""evidence that vaccination induces a profound impairment in Type I interferon (IFN) signaling, which has various adverse consequences to human health"".  This statement relies on an [unpublished preprint available on MedRxiv since August 2021](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.20.21255677v2), thus not yet peer-reviewed.

Data show a differential gene expression profile in peripheral dendritic cells based on vaccinal status, but **do not support the authors’ claim that there is Type I IFN suppression due to the vaccine**.

Reliable research shows this is simply the reaction expected from a vaccine: a high immune response without a systemic and uncontrolled inflammation ([1](https://www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com/article/S1198-743X(21)00604-2/fulltext),[2](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/5/467),[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521661621001029?via%3Dihub)).

Furthermore, **arguing that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination would result in loss of the Type I IFN immune response (and therefore leading to a higher infectious risk or lack of cancer surveillance) contradicts other published data on the immune response** ([4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03791-x)).

At the opposite, a transient increase of Type I IFN could explain some immune side effects caused by vaccination ([5](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.abj9256),[6](https://academic.oup.com/ibdjournal/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ibd/izac031/6537472)).  To date **only a set of SARS-COV-2 viral proteins have been shown to antagonize Type I IFN response, not the vaccine** ([7](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.648004/full),[8](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32979938/),[9](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abc6027)).

Secondly, the authors used more than 200 references, including **misunderstandings of other authors’ conclusions**.  I'll detail a non-exhaustive list of such misunderstandings of the literature in a comment below.

The authors rely on **hypothetical physiological disturbances** induced by vaccination. For example, they suggest a possible increased risk of various cancers **which has never been published so far**, whereas for patients with cancer, vaccination is still highly recommended ([10](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34718117/),[11](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35189538/)).

**No causal relationship can be established between the described biological mechanisms and the alleged effects of mRNA vaccines in this article**. The misuse and the erroneous interpretations which can result from the VAERS database has been extensively described ([12](https://www.science.org/content/article/antivaccine-activists-use-government-database-side-effects-scare-public),[13](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2022.826327/full),[14](https://infodemiology.jmir.org/2022/1/e33587)).

Besides, the analysis proposed by the authors only takes into account the relative values of the occurrences of several adverse events for SARS-COV-2 or non- SARS-COV-2 vaccines without taking into account either the number of injections for each vaccine or the differences in pharmacovigilance.

Thus, **no conclusion can be drawn from this analysis**. To date no published analysis of the data from the VAERS database supports the hypothesis of a significant increased mortality secondary to vaccination ([15](https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(21)00684-2/fulltext)), confirming that anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has a very favorable risk-benefit ratio and saved and will save lives ([16](https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(21)00856-7/fulltext),[17](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00947-8/fulltext)).

This is a crime against humanity, facilitated by a global campaign of terror. It is a crime against humanity - but what will our future be like if we cannot admit it and face it and return to a place of healing and of authentic safety?

I have heard no 'pro-vaxxer' apologize for this state of affairs either adequately (impossible?) or even inadequately (inevitable?) - this is one hot potato nobody on the 'pro' side of the debate seems to wish to touch.

About a year ago network tv started airing commercials from local hospitals, all framed around ""regular checkups"" for your ""personal health"". This all started about 6 months after the massive rollout of the covid vaccines. These commercials always start out with something like ""how are you feeling?"" And the sentiment of ""regular checkups and screenings will help catch any health issues early. This is essential to your health"". 
And *now* they have started the same exact style commercials but *geared toward children*. These commercials revolve around the sentiment of ""do you notice any warning signs in your children or anything out of the ordinary? Catching these things early is essential to your childs health, and creating a healthy relationship with your doctor and regular checkups for your child is essential in maintaining your childs health"". These commercials revolving around pediatric health coincided perfectly with the vaccine emergency use authorization for children.
Anyone paying attention to the rollout of these vaccines knows what this is about. It's about getting ahead of the narrative regarding what is causing the inconsistencies in the population's health. They know that millions of people are now experiencing strange health anomolies and making sure to give answers as to the cause *before* the word really gets out as to exactly *how many* people have been affected by the injections they recieved.",vyhh78,32,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/vyhh78/has_anyone_else_seen_these_personal_health/

734,The Vaccine Debate Snowball ...,"- The Great Awakening - 

We The People, are at a tipping point. 

We have been studying vaccines, and vaccine problems, for many years,

and only recently have all of the necessary components come together at the same time and place, 

for a mass awakening, 

that vaccines are bioweapons, 

and vaccines have always been bioweapons.
______

insert: astronaut pointing a gun at another astronauts back meme

_______

So what has come together ?

1) the COVID 19 ""pandemic"" and ""vaccine"" has grabbed the worlds attention, 

and the public has been immersed in vaccine chatter for long enough that they somewhat have a vaccine interest, and/or a vaccine opinion, 

and they have probably been coerced and/or forced into taking some action on vaccines. 

so COVID / vaccines required everyone to become ""active"" in one way, shape or form. 


2) The Vaccine Debate Snowball 

the anti-vaxxers have long been trying to work out the exact mechanisms by which vaccines cause adverse reactions, and i believe that they have built some very simple, easy to understand models for explaining how vaccines can cause problems.  

example: fever of 101F vs fever of 105F

3) we all have smart phones now!

4) YOU!

_____

there are only 2 steps to any revolution:

step 1: educate yourself

step 2: educate others

_______

The Vaccine Debate Snowball has been snowballing for many years BEFORE covid, 

and in my opinion, part of the purpose of the COVID/vaccine PsyOp,

was to counter the anti-vaccine narrative, that was coalescing online,  

memes like ""Vaccines Cause SIDS"" are kind hard to refute, 

without opening up the door to more inquiry into SIDS and vaccines...

the COVID/vaccine narrative successfully did a FORUM SLIDE of all the old vaccine debates, which have now been memory-holed, 
_____

BUT, the time is ripe, for YOU, to immerse yourself in the details of the current vaccine debate, 

The anti-vaccine arguments have been fleshed out to such a degree, 

that it is now possible for even lay-people to watch very complex debates about vaccines, 

and the lay people can watch the back-and-forth, of the vaccine debate, 

and as the lay people watch, they learn the language, the models, 

they are able to get a good sense of the main talking points, 

and common refutations. 

______

this is step 1 of the revolution: educate yourself

if you educate yourself, then you are able to educate others. 

but HOW is a lay-person to ""educate themselves"" about vaccines?

in my opinion, the best debates are being held at 

https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/new

https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments

just immerse yourself in the debates, and hear-out every side, so you have a good understanding of the points and counter-points, 

and by doing this, you will slowly build a new model in your mind, for how vaccines actually work, 

and how exactly it is that vaccines can sometimes cause adverse reactions.

and once you have this new working model in your mind, you will be able to ask new questions, and ponder new answers, 

and also to proceed to step 2 which is to educate others

_______

*the revolution does not happen on the street. the revolution happens in your mind*

_____

here is a video that will bring you up to speed on the history of the vaccine debate, up to COVID. 

The man speaking is Paul Offit, who is a highly esteemed vaccine researcher, who is credited with saving the lives of millions of people, with his vaccines.

Paul Offit has a very long, solid career in vaccines, and is highly-esteemed in the pro-vaccine world. 

Paul Offit is a BIG celebrity in the vaccine world, 

so if you cite Paul Offit as your source, it's usually considered to be rock-solid by the pro-vaccine side.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Offit   

Paul Offit - Communicating Science to the Public: The Vaccine-Autism Controversy 

1h:13m

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToCVXmW9AMU

TLDW: Offit goes thru the history of the various anti-vaccine theories in sequential order, debunking them one-by-one, 

BUT at the end of the video, Offit finally gets around to talking about ADJUVANTS, 

and you can tell by his body language, and his tone of voice, and his general demeanor, and attitude, that OFFIT KNOWS.

OFFIT KNOWS that ADJUVANTS are a big part of the problem, 
______

and once you establish the simple fact that ADJUVANTS are designed to cause a ""strong"" immune response to something that would not normally cause a strong immune response, 

we open the door to things like autoimmune disorders and ""allergies""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunologic_adjuvant

_______

Here is another video featuring Paul Offit doing a great job of explaining ADE, 

and once you understand Offit's ADE model, you will be able to use that model to understand how COVID ""vaccines"" are causing ""ADE"" and ""AIDS"" and ""VAIDS""

and Mercks disease in chickens 

43 minutes

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbTNPsbAThk

So for an investment of about 2 hours of your time, you can ""educate yourself"" about the current state of the vaccine debate, without having to endure thru years of tedious debates, false leads, disappointments, that hard-core anti-vaxxers have had to go thru.

stay abreast in the current vaccine debate, 

and read every day, as much as you can stand to read,

and develop a discerning taste, and a good eye for top-qualty content, 

and when you find good content, share it with someone, somehow.

745,The truth is we are now one killer Covid variant away from forced vaccinations,"In any country if the government were to forcefully vaccinate the public, especially with a highly experimental vaccine, there would be a revolution. People would fight back, protest, burn down vaccination centers... Police and military would refuse to do anything about it.

But by using soft mandates, that is social pressure and exclusion from society, they succeeded in getting 80% to 100% of adults in developed countries vaccinated. Since 70% was the set target, pressure to vaccinate has since been let up.

The problem is that this might just be a short reprieve, a pause in an offensive to give the enemy a false sense of safety, before you attack harder than ever.

They have set up a system of control that even China could not pull off before 2020. One where they can lock down society and borders at will, and they know who didn't take the vaccine and where they are.

All they need now is a new variant that really kills, and whip up a propaganda storm to blame the unvaccinated. At that point all people will voluntarily go into house arrest for fear of infection, it's what they've been trained to do for the last 3 years.

And then the government can send police door to door, as they do in China, in full body suits no one will dare to intervene for fear that their unvaccinated neighbor might be infected. They will be able to forcefully vaccinate on the spot, or put them in the quarantine camps they built where there will be no witnesses.",zxz4ph,52,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/zxz4ph/the_truth_is_we_are_now_one_killer_covid_variant/

But now the situation has changed: 70-90% of people worldwide got vaccinated depending on the region (except for Africa but numbers are climbing there), and boosted as well. Now if the ADE theory is correct, that means people have a much weaker natural immunity than ever before, and are extremely vulnerable to any kind of disease. The huge increase in all cause deaths, including SADS, child heart attacks and unknown cause of death, seems to confirm this.

But this winter is when things get really dangerous, a perfect storm as Omicron keeps on mutating at a frightening speed, and everyone keeps taking boosters. If one of these mutations turns deadly then it could go through the vaccinated like a hot knife through butter, while leaving the unvaccinated untouched.

758,How can we trust the government?,"How can we trust the government when they do the following? The number 1 cause of medical conspiracies in my opinion is how the government handled the pandemic. It is a classic case of the boy who cried wolf. When you do this, you put people off even legitimate medical interventions, and this is a shame. For example, we have people not wanting to get legitimate and necessary vaccines such as the tetanus vaccine now, due to the government's lies in the pandemic, which created high levels of mistrust, so in the future even if they say something right, people won't believe them. The consequences morally fall on the government in my opinion.

&#x200B;

The problem is that even the judges don't understand the science. They too have unwittingly fallen prey to ""vax vs antivax"" and think there is nothing in between. For example, they keep violating the constitutional rights of people who don't want vaccinated organ or blood transplants, even though there is clear concern as per the legitimate scientific literature. They too automatically trust the ""science"" that is subjective garbage coming out of the mouths of the government-appointed ""experts"" who are either unaware of the science themselves or deliberately acting dumb to push the interests of those they work for.

&#x200B;

There has been a convincing study from Harvard university (obviously a fake institution that was founded in 1636 after a group of people predicted that in 2020 there would be a pandemic and they would need to crate bogus scientific journal articles to bash the vaccine, obviously) showing circulating spike in the blood of the vaccinated who have myocarditis:

&#x200B;

There has been a study presented to the American Heart Association showing that the spike protein alone can cause direct damage to the heart:

&#x200B;

[https://newsroom.heart.org/news/coronavirus-spike-protein-activated-natural-immune-response-damaged-heart-muscle-cells](https://newsroom.heart.org/news/coronavirus-spike-protein-activated-natural-immune-response-damaged-heart-muscle-cells)

&#x200B;

This link shows the difference between the spike protein from the virus vs the spike protein in the vaccine, the only difference is that the one in the vaccine got a tiny tweak so it does not shift shape to latch onto the ACE2 receptor:

&#x200B;

[https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/vaccines/tiny-tweak-behind-COVID-19/98/i38](https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/vaccines/tiny-tweak-behind-COVID-19/98/i38)

&#x200B;

but if you read the excerpt from the study presented to the American Heart Associate above, it implies that this tweak is not sufficient to protect against the dangers of the spike protein.

&#x200B;

Those with long covid and vaccine injury complain of the same symptoms. The common denominator is the spike protein, that is in the virus as well as the vaccine. I am not the only one bringing up this concern, the former Australian Medical Association President shares these concerns:

&#x200B;

>“Within this group of vaccine injured individuals, there is a diminishing cohort of people who have symptoms following immunisation, many of which are similar to Long Covid (such as fatigue and brain fog), but who have not had a Covid infection. These people would be an important subset or control group for studies looking into the pathophysiology, causes of and treatments for Long Covid. It is possible that there is at least some shared pathophysiology between vaccine injury and Long Covid, possibly due to the effects of spike protein.”

Yet in Canada, the science is ignored, and instead the government relies on people such as this law professor, who has no specialized medical training, who has ties to the federal government, as the arbiter of what does and what doesn't constitute as ""misinformation"" in the context of vaccine safety, which he has no specialized medical knowledge about:

&#x200B;

So let's forget Harvard University, let's forget the American Heart Association, let's forget the former President of the Australian Medical Association, but listen to a guy with ties to the Trudeau government who is a law professor and has no specialized medical training, on whether vaccines are safe or not and to what degree.

&#x200B;

In this link he talks about vaccine transplant recipients:

&#x200B;

>""Potential organ recipients “are agreeing to take someone else’s organ into their bodies, to take immune suppressants and are accepting other required vaccines, but they don't want this vaccine, which is probably the most studied vaccine in human history,” and demonstrated to be safe and effective, says Caulfield.""

&#x200B;

This makes no sense. Obviously organ recipients are agreeing to take someone else's organs/take immune suppressants and take other vaccines, BECAUSE THEY HAVE TOO, IT IS MEDICALLY NECESSARY. How on earth does that mean they must be forced to take a NEW vaccine that there is legitimate concern (as studies from Harvard and such show) that it may cause organ damage and cause the problematic spike protein to circulate in the blood? Then he finishes off with a vague ""the most studied vaccine in human history"". This is irrelevant. I can study something for 10 million years, but if I dig my head in the sand and ignore the studies that don't fit the narrative I want to push, that doesn't mean anything. Also, he is ignoring timeline. It was heavily studied NOW, but it was studied far less than other medical interventions in terms of time, theses vaccines only came out around 2 years ago. Other vaccines have been there much longer.

&#x200B;

How could this guy pass a judgement when he is clearly unaware of the basic science surrounding this? Is he even aware of the studies I posted above? If yes, then why is he saying what he is saying? And if no, doesn't that mean if a lay person like me knows this, why on earth are we expected to listen to a ""misinformation expert"" who isn't even aware of these findings?

But until now I haven't paid any thought to the fact that livestock all receive them, and by eating them I will be taking that into my body, albeit at a lesser rate than if I was having it directly injected.

Due to health and sensitivity to what I put in my body, I'm already at the point where I try to limit my animal produce intake to cleaner stuff like free range eggs, wild caught fish and venison caught from the wild, and mostly fresh veg, lentils, pulse and legumes the rest of the time. It's hard because that stuff is expensive and hard to come by in big supermarket chains. Now my goal is to eventually not have any of it, and just eat what I and others around me can cultivate ourselves.

I really think that growing our own produce is a necessary step if we want the freedom to choose to not having vaccines and other toxins be put in our bodies. I'm firmly of the belief that the toxicity of the food supply - pesticides, herbicides and fungicides and all the other cides included too - is one of the fundamental causes of sickness in our society. We just need to be putting less toxic stuff in our bodies, and our health would improve, and surely that means livestock injected with multiple vaccines, as well as antibiotics, growth hormones and all the rest.

763,The vaccinated are responsible for the current covid spike,"It seems to me that getting vaccinated mounts a defense to covid 19.  Covid 19 is always in the air and you are always exposed to it to some degree, but it is generally with higher viral loads that you will get sick.

We know vaccine efficacy wanes, so when that happens how your body knows to fight covid is diminished and you are this more likely to catch covid.  Taking the vax makes it likely you will get an infection when the dissapation happens, which is around 6 months.

So the thing is is that everyone took their booster around the same time, so it created a dynamic where everyone is getting sick at the same time, which anecdotedly i noticed in may.

Now if people had just left it to their natural immunity they'd have much longer term immunity and if/when people did get sick it wouldn't be with these spikes all at once.

Especially for young and healthy natural immunity (which most had acquired before they had the option to take the vaccine) is the way to go.

781,China opening their borders could be deadly to the vaccinated,"I don't get how no one sees a problem with China opening up, right after 70% of their people got infected with a variant that exists nowhere else. This is how we got into this mess, when Chinese tourists spread the original Covid. Back then only a handful were infected and Covid spread relatively slowly. With Omicron it spread much faster, but it was relatively harmless.

This time the new variant coming out of China will not only spread faster, it will also be deployed faster, because China tourists are flying everywhere at once as we speak. 10's of millions of Chinese are leaving China, with even more Chinese visiting China only to return to their foreign residencies later on. That means this new variant will show up in every major population center at the same time, and spread at record speeds, so it could be the dominant global variant within a week.

And because it spreads so fast, and we don't know how the rest of the world will react to it, it holds an enormous danger. Because if it is dangerous, then by the time governments admit this, it will already be too late, as everyone will already be infected under the ""live with Covid policy"". It is especially dangerous to the vaccinated, because they've had their immunity altered and this has not been tested on this new variant, specifically within China where they only got the Chinese vaccines. And because it will spread so blindingly fast, there will be zero warning this time.

Even the science sub now admits that the mRNA vaccines cause myocarditis, and last week the FDA quietly added blood clots to the list of side effects. Well what happens when all these people who might have myocarditis or blood clots are exposed to some exotic new variant, that their vaccinated bodies have no defense against and their natural immunity weakened?

Now on day 5 or maybe 9..not sure thanks to the inaccurate rapid home tests, and I'm still alive and kickin' (knock on wood).  It's been mild, but a new weird symptoms each day and awful insomnia.   It's the strangest thing I've ever had.       This new variant assumed B4/5 is so damn contagious.  Numbers are probably 5 times than what is reported b/c of all the false negatives, home tests not reported and drop in PCR testing due to federal funding ending and we have to pay big.  As if everything else in this life isn't expensive.   CEO visited office last week and the 2 guys who have traveled all over the past  almost 2 years who never have caught it, woke up with high fevers this morning since the CEO flew back home and tested positive  yesterday.    Half of the employees are already reporting symptoms..  Most of ones we know are boosted.  It's a crazy virus.   If you find yourself worried, feel free to send me a DM here.   I can list out all natural supplements/things that might help....mostly help prevent long-term symptoms.

Stay well, everyone and please don't trust the negatives on the home rapids if you have symptoms.   Throat swab, not nasal swab... This is a whole different variant..

791,Something I could tell my colleague to change his mind?,"A colleague of mine told me that maybe he'll be sick for a few days next week because he's scheduled to get another booster on Monday and feeling unwell afterwards is something that happened to him before, which is why he expects it could happen again.

He hopes that getting Novavax this time might be better. So far he has 1 x AZ and 2 x Pfizer.

He's an immigrant and in many regards very skeptical towards our western propaganda. For example when it comes to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine he says things like ""truth dies first in a war"" and that the news about this are just propaganda. But for some reason that doesn't apply at all to the covid-propaganda. He says he has two relatives who became doctors in two different non-western countries and they tell him it's a good idea to get vaccinated. He says that the reactions he had after the shots were a good thing because they showed it's working.

Our conversations often are very lighthearted and this leads to the impression that neither of us are really serious when talking about things.  
For example I said: ""The vaccine comes in different flavors: Myocarditis, Turbo-Cancer, Brain-vein-thrombosis and of course sudden adult death-syndrome.""  
He asked what sudden adult death-syndrome was supposed to be. I explained it and then he remembered having seen something fitting this description in a video and showed it to me.

So he is aware of the phenomenon and apparently just dismisses it as unrelated to vaccination.

I guess he thinks that my reasons not to be vaccinated are a funny joke or something and that I'm practicing self-irony when talking about it. Like he simply doesn't think that I could be serious about it.

795,Have mass mis / disinformation campaigns affected outcomes and indeed the future of humanity?,"As we all saw at the beginning of 2020 state level mis / disinformation campaigns ramped up on the internet, almost exclusively targeting social media.  


Whilst Russia and China both **blatantly lied** about their claimed virtually non-existent levels of coronavirus cases (Russia was observed to have a large increase in ""pneumonia"" cases during this time, and China simply blocked attempts for anyone to tell what was happening), they were busy instead spreading lies across the internet to sow chaos in enemy countries. Enemy countries of course, being anyone else, but particularly USA and Europe. Russia saw some blowback here, as the Russian public accessed Western media and ended up spreading some of their own misinformation internally, which jeopardised their own vaccine campaigns.  


As a result a shotgun blast of anti-vaccine viewpoints was created and amplified, spreading some of the most obvious cases of **mass hysteria** in the modern age. The fact that claims like the vaccine contained a tracking device or made you magnetic was physically impossible didn't matter, because the public had no understanding of that. ""Doctors"" who were actually just frauds like chiropractors were seen to be issuing incorrect health advice which they weren't remotely qualified to give.  


And it appears to have worked. There simply is not an effective tactic for countering such massive levels of misinformation. Even Mark Twain observed that ""*a lie will fly around the whole world while the truth is getting its boots on*"". A new 'generation' of grifters and scammers quickly caught onto the potential for profit and as long as they they phrased their claims carefully enough, there has been **little real repercussions** for them as they filtered subscription fees and ""donations"" from their fearful and paranoid followers.  


Now we face a potential public health crisis as the mislead fail to use evidence-based medicine to as high a degree. Naturally **children will disproportionately suffer** if levels of vaccine preventable disease return over the next few years, which they almost certainly will. The adults who mistakenly withhold such preventative treatments from the children in their guardianship have for the most part been sensibly vaccinated by their parents who saw the world that existed before it was as well protected. They'll still bring them to the hospital when things get bad and expect miracles though.

812,Why I decided to vaccinate my kid,"For fear of autism, I at one point decided not to vaccinate or at the very least to use some alternate schedule. To make a long story short, after years of being anxious and looking things up on Google, I changed my mind. And it’s not because I thinks vaccines are totally safe. 
However, I’ve come to realize that if vaccines “can cause autism”, then so can a million other things. It’s the body’s response to environmental triggers that can change the way the brain develops. 
For example, we know a strong immune response from the mother during pregnancy can increase the risk of neurological disorders in her baby. Guess what causes an immune response? Everything! You can’t avoid it! Mosquito bites, allergies, colds, etc. Also, pesticides have been linked to an increased autism risk. There’s endless things that can trigger a baby’s brain to take on a certain developmental path. If you think you’re going to avoid all those triggers you’re wrong :) if the genes are there, they will likely be turned on.
I’m not saying that we should all expose ourselves to risk factors for diseases and not care. But there are other risk factors for autism besides the immune response from a vaccine, and avoiding these risks don’t put the health of our society in danger. And the final straw for me was realizing that there are not only countless, unavoidable, possible triggers for autism, but that there are also countless things which reduce your child’s risk of developing autism. Like getting plenty of choline during pregnancy! Bottom line is you will not avoid all possible triggers for autism in your child’s life. For the vast majority of cases, you will not be able to say that one thing definitively caused their autism and rule everything else out. You can simply do your best to keep your child healthy and take steps that are proven to reduce the risk. 
I just wanted to post this for anyone else who was on the fence and scared about vaccines. To this day I truly don’t think vaccines are as safe as people claim, but I acknowledge the benefits are worth the small risk. And I acknowledge that not vaccinating your child for fear of something you can’t even control is pointless and just puts others at risk.",vev0k7,0,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/vev0k7/why_i_decided_to_vaccinate_my_kid/
813,"70% of the world population is now genetically marked by just a handful of vaccines, creating a biohazard for natural and artificial killer viruses","In the last Bond movie, the story was about a lab made killer virus that was passed on through physical contact, and could be programmed to kill only specific people, based on their DNA.

Well that's kind of possible now, as 70% of people are now vaccinated with a handful of vaccines, and large groups with just one specific vaccine brand. This means these people could be more easily and specifically targeted by natural or artificial viruses.

Geert Vanden Bossche warned of this back in May, saying we were about to see the rise of new variants that would be immune to the vaccine, and even mutate to attach themselves the vaccinated more easily, resulting in much higher infection rates and thus deaths. We got that variant with Centaurus, and although this hasn't caused massed deaths so far (officially), winter is here so this could be very dangerous.

And from a warfare perspective China and Russia used very different vaccines than the rest of the world. That means that if China were to develop a deadly virus in their Wuhan bioweapons lab (to name a random place), then they could program this virus to only target people who took the Pfizer, Moderna, AZ and J&J vaccine. This then would kill 90% of people in neighboring countries (for example Taiwan where close to 100% of adults took it) and the West (hard to fight China if you have no soldiers left), while leaving the vast majority of Chinese unaffected.

In addition we don't know if the vaccines that China exported to other countries are identical to the ones they used domestically. Meaning China might actually target those as well, as they were widely used in the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia, 3 countries that contest China's territorial claims.

In the same way, Russia could use a killer virus to defeat Ukrainian or NATO soldiers by targeting the Western vaccines. Although it wouldn't work as well in Ukraine where most people refused to take it.",xgdpnn,96,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/xgdpnn/70_of_the_world_population_is_now_genetically/

>11.9. The issue of potential mutagenicity and genotoxicity is of high importance and received  attention at Australian Senate Estimates on 1 June 2021 (Community Affairs Legislation Committee)  
>  
> 11.10. In that hearing, Prof. Skerritt (head of the Australian TGA) by Senator Malcolm Roberts on the potential for the mRNA to enter the nucleus of cells and cause potentially  serious genetic adverse events which could affect future generations:    
>  
>Senator ROBERTS: ""*How long before we know the intergenerational effects?""*  
>  
>Dr Skerritt: ""*There is no evidence at all from animal or human studies that the RNA vaccines, if you're talking about them, incorporate into the genetic material of human beings. They wouldn't have received regulatory approval, and that includes by much bigger regulators such as the FDA, if these bits of mRNA incorporated into the human genetic material. In fact, medicines that incorporate into human genetic material and are inherited are currently not permitted in most major countries, including Australia.”* 

Now I know the CDC has recently removed the statement that the spike protein does not stay in the body for very long... I'm also pretty sure the vaccine doesn't actually contain any spike protein, but the mRNA triggers the body to produce spike protein, is that correct? Please correct me if I'm wrong here, just trying to understand better...

I also know that the UK has recently withdrawn their recommendation for pregnant & breastfeeding women to get vaccinated. 

Now I believe there was the [Sweden study](https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/44/3/73/htm) shows that the mRNA encodes into the liver cell lines, is that right? I've had a quick look and there seem to be the regular round of fact-check articles trying to discredit it, so would be grateful for any discussion around that to help me understand it better. 

What I'm really looking for is data & evidence that shows that the covid vaccines have been shown to alter/affect DNA or genetic material, because if there is any evidence of that, surely that would make them illegal in Australia according to the statements of our own head of the TGA (essentially Australia's version of the FDA for those playing overseas).

In particular I'm looking for the usual pro-vax players in here to try and argue / discredit this.

820,Unusual amount of deaths,"Why is there no investigation into the excess deaths and unusually high celebrity deaths? My hypothesis is that the spike protein is damaging people's hearts. We are seeing 3 groups dying at unusually high rates A) old people B) people who use drugs that affect the heart such as cocaine C) young athletes, as exercise puts a lot of pressure on the heart in the moment.

So it would be reasonable to expect that these would be the first victims of the spike protein. Will other/normal demographics start dropping like flies years down the line? According to public health ""experts"": let's wait and see, who CARES about doing a SINGLE study or investigation about this?

Every time someone famous dies, they either say it was old age, or unknown cause of death. Well, old age is not mutually exclusive to damage from the spike protein. As I mentioned, it would be reasonable to expect the weakest/those with the biggest pressure on their heart already to die first, and that seems to be what is happening.

These were all the strangely high number of famous deaths in the past 1-2 years, I have never seen so many famous people die so close to each other/all in the span of 1-2 years :

The Queen, who seemed to live forever, died of ""old age"" (rather vague).

The Pope, who seemed to live forever, died with no cause given.

Diego Maradona, who used cocaine when he was younger, died of a heart attack at age 60. Strange that he didn't die of a heart attack all those years.

His brother, Hugo Maradona, also a soccer player, also died of a heart attack at age 52 1 year after Diego died.

Pele died the same year he got vaccinated and got covid, the state cause was cancer, but he died the same year he got vaccinated and covid, his cancer didn't seem to kill him before that. Keep his mind his mother is still alive, and she is over 100 years old.

DMX, who used cocaine throughout his life, died of a heart attack at age 50, again, strange that the heart attack came directly in April 2021 and not any time before that even though he used cocaine numerous times throughout his life.

Tina Turner, who had high blood pressure for decades, died after ""years of illnesses"". Again, strange that the ""years of illnesses spanning a decade decided not to kill her until 1-2 years ago.

Jerry Springer died due to cancer, but again it is not necessarily mutually exclusive, especially since rates of cancer are also going up recently.

Bob Saget, dead at 65, his official cause was ""blunt head trauma"" but it was said no foul play was suspected, and he appeared to fall down in his room and hit his head. What might have caused him to suddenly fall down out of the blue? Of course, it was never mentioned.

Lisa Marie Presley, cardiac arrest at age 54.

Bill Russel, NBA legend, dead at 88 with no cause of death given.

Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid in Harry Potter), dead due to multiple organ failure including heart block.

This one wasn't a death but superstar soccer player Sergio Aguero had to retire at age 32, in 2021 (out of all years), due to heart arrhythmia. I can't remember the last time EVER that a player this famous had to retire prematurely due to a heart, or any other issue.

These are the most famous ones, off the top of my head. Which other 1-2 years had so many global household names names die?

Here are some other less famous but still famous ones:

Ivana Trump, dead after injuries to torso (again, not mutually exclusive, typically mild injuries to torso doesn't kill people I would assume) at 73.

Clarence Gilyard Jr, ""Die Hard"" actor, dead at 60, no cause of death given

Tony Sirico, ""Sopranos"" actor, no cause of death, but they tried to relate it to his pre-existing dementia (again, not necessarily mutually exclusive

Peter Bogdanovich, ""Sopranos"" actor, dead at 82 due to ""complications from Parkinsons"" that did not kill him until 2022 out of all years, the same year that another start from the Sopranos (Tony Sirico) also died, talk about a coincidence...

Paul Sorvino, ""Goodfellas"" actor, died at 88 with no cause given.

Ray Liotta, ""Goodfellas"" actor, died at 67 due to heart failure and respiratory issues. Again, 2 big name stars who played in gangster movies, and the literal same movie Sopranos, dying within the same year, what are the chances. How often does do these double movie/show deaths happen, statistically/historically?

NFL player Marion Barker, dead at 38 due to heat stroke

Cedric McMillan, bodybuilding champions dead at 44 due to heart attack

Taylor Hawkins from ""Foo Fighters"" band, dead at 50 due to cardiac arrest

Then we have famous but slightly less famous young people who died of heart related complications, such as actor Ray Stevenson, musician Brian Gillis heart attack at age 46, actor Lance Reddick who died of ""natural causes"" at age 60, rapper Costa Titch who died on stage after collapsing at age 28, actor Jansen Panettiere who died from enlarged heart at age 28, rapper David Jolicoeur who had heart issues since 2017 that did not kill him until 2023, actor Cody longo who died in his sleep (which is common with heart issues) at age 34 but it is being reported that he died from alcohol poisoning even though that was simply his family's guess because they said he drank excessively in the past (yet it magically didn't kill him until 2023), musician Mark Sheehan from an ""undisclosed illness"" at age 46, Paul Cattermole of Sclub7 who died of ""natural causes"" at the age of 46 (??), then others with no stated cause of death such as DJ Shog aged 46. actor Adam Rich from Eight is Enough, dead at 54 with no cause given.

People will call me a conspiracy theorist and say that I am saying ""anecdotes"". Well, in the absence of proper data and studies, anecdotes are all we have to go by. Also, excess mortality is a thing now since in 2022 for many countries, but of course they don't break down by the cause of death. I am simply try to raise awareness to call for more research in this important issue. Even if anecdotal, I have never seen SO many famous people die so close to each other, with a strangely high correlation with heart related issues.",13uoxxu,38,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/13uoxxu/unusual_amount_of_deaths/

If I am concerned about vaccine safety - what has that to do with 'pro' or 'anti'? - If one is concerned about vaccine safety - one is concerned about what a vaccine is. The word safety - does not belong to those who would silence legitimate concern. Either we are all interested in vaccine safety - or only some of us are.,vdp59l,36,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/vdp59l/vaccine_safety/

823,The unvaccinated saved the world!,"As has been so loudly stated by the mob:

""The unvaccinated are a breeding ground for new covid-19 variants"".

Covid-19 has mutated to become more transmissible but significantly less deadly, which in turn has decreased death rates from Covid-19 substantially.

824,"Dear Pro-vaxxers, debunking the claims of anti-vaxxers doesn't prove that the Covid vaccines work.","Admittedly some of the arguments made by so labelled *anti-vaxxers* are rather bizarre, but some are quite sound and we could nitpick over these points forever, so I have a simple question to ask.

It is over 2 years since the vaccines were authorized and if they are efficacious and safe as you claim, the evidence should be available by now. (notwithstanding the fact that our most eminent Dr Toni Fauci is on record as stating that it may take 12 years for the side effects of a drug to emerge).

Do you believe that for all the age ranges  and health profiles the vaccines are recommended to, the benefits outweigh the risks, and do you have the body of peer-reviewed research to support your views?

All your posts are about criticising those you call anti-vaxxers, so lets see your views on the safety and efficacy of the vax, which should be at the heart of your argument.

If you believe the actual benefits of the vaccines are proven, and that for all people the vaccines are recommended to, the potential benefits outweigh the risks, provide the evidence you have to support your views and have them challenged and debated.

That would be a whole lot better than debunking anti-vaxxers.

It is up to you pro-vaxxers to present your supporting evidence and defeat the evidence and arguments against them.

So far you have fixated on debunking anti-vax arguments, but even without anti-vaxxers the onus is on your pro-vaxxers to make a supporting case regardless of anti-vaxxers.

The ball is and has always been in your court.

I await your responses with bated breadth.

Yours sincerely and most anticipatingly,

826,Bridging the divide between pro and anti covid vaxxers....,"I honestly don't see how it can be done, and a big part of the reason is that the politics surrounding the jabs has taken the front seat, leaving the facts and the data relegated to the rear....and that's on both sides of the debate.

Take the case of sudden deaths, often unexplained.  For those of us on the anti covid jab side, we point to the reporting of these events, and if not smoking gun ""proof"", we at least see it as a very strong indication of at least the potential risks associated with the pokes.

The problem is that unexplained deaths happened before the covid jabs...we just weren't paying attention before.  I just got into an exchange with someone on Twitter and through this conversation discovered the story of a HS football player who died in 2019, but his parents had to wait 10 months for an official cause....and there are lots of these stories.  Here's a link from 2018 about another young football player dying due to a brain injury.

[https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/09/health/dylan-thomas-georgia-high-school-football-cause-of-death/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/09/health/dylan-thomas-georgia-high-school-football-cause-of-death/index.html)

In 2021 or anytime afterward of course, those of us on the anti-jabb side, we might very well point to a death such as the one linked above and speculated that the covid shot played a role.  The point is that it's true, these types of deaths....due to heart and brain issues, or for unexplained reasons....these deaths were happening before.

The question is this....is it more now, less, or about the same?

What I would ultimately like to know is what the actual numbers are for any given population for the years 2015 to 2019.  It doesn't really matter to me which population, so long as the data collection is consistent and that it can be measured against the same numbers for the years 2021 and 2022.

The problem is who do you trust?  If it's Peter McCullough or some other expert who has basically put their reputations on the line by staking out an anti-vaxx stance, are they going to massage the data to boost the 2021/2022 numbers and under report the deaths from years previous....the aim being to strengthen their argurment of a  causational link.  On the other hand how can you trust authorities which pushed heavily for vaccine mandates, forcing players to take the jabs.  They will have a vested interest in downplaying even a potential link....

So in digging for the truth you're left with competing narratives, with each side having a biased view and the potential motivation to fudge the numbers:  ""Well....we won't include ***these particular deaths*** in our calculations because they'll just muddy the waters"".

My own personal anti covid jab stance is borne out of reliable first hand accounts of adverse events (including 4 deaths) in the past two years....non fatal events include a couple survived heart attacks, two strokes, a massive anneurysm as well as a laundry list of various issues with major organs like heart, liver and kidney issues.

Still...in discussing my refusal it would be nice to have something more firm than just anecdotal evidence.  But trust in the reporting agencies, (basically all of whom pushed for the jabs relentlessly right from the start) and guys like McCullough and Malone showing up on Alex Jones' 'Info Wars' does nothing to boost their credibility...quite the opposite.",11sv5vm,19,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/11sv5vm/bridging_the_divide_between_pro_and_anti_covid/

* Key findings:
   * the combined efficacy of full vaccination (1-2 weeks after full vaccination) was
      * 44.5% (95% CI 27.8–57.4) for asymptomatic infections
      * 76.5% (69.8–81.7) for symptomatic infections (average decrease of 13.6% (5.5–22.3) per month after full vaccination)

* Notes: this is interesting as it doesn't study vaccines directly but rather statistically derives the effects of different control methods on R0
* Type: (not a clinical trial) mathematical model
* Sample size: global population
* Origin / affiliation of researchers: West China School of Public Health and West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China
* Vaccines under study: all
* Key findings:
   * all of nucleic acid testing, vaccination, and restricting population mobility were statistically significantly, negatively correlated with the R0
   * restricting population mobility had the strongest effect, nucleic acid testing had a strong effect, while vaccination had a much smaller effect comparatively
   * vaccines alone cannot reduce transmissibility with omicron's immune escape
* Strengths:
   * quantifies the effect of public health policy
   * covers omicron (up to May 14, 2022)
   * provides reasonable evidence that vaccination rate alone should not be used to determine whether control measures can be relaxed
* Limitations:
   * lack of precision localised data
   * fails to capture complex interaction between different factors affect transmissibility

# Studies on the efficacy of a booster dose

**Study 1:**

* Type: test-negative case-control study
* Sample size: 893 845
* Origin / affiliation of researchers: UK Health Security Agency and NIHR
* Vaccines under study: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AZ
* Key findings:
   * effectiveness against symptomatic disease relative to primary series
      * effectiveness peaked at 14–35 days after Pfizer BioNTech booster at 89.6% (95% CI, 88.6–90.4) and 95.3% (91.8–97.3) after Moderna booster vs. only a primary course of AZ
      * effectiveness 14-34 days after Pfizer booster was 82.8% (81.8-83.7) and after Moderna 90.9% (84.5–94.7) vs. a primary course of Pfizer (slight waning for Pfizer, no data for Moderna)
   * effectiveness against hospitalization 14-34 days after Pfizer booster for age 50 or above (similar for younger age group) relative to unvaccinated
      *  99.2% (95% CI, 98.6–99.5) when the primary course was AZ
      *  98.6% (95% CI, 98.0–99.0) with Pfizer primary course
   * effectiveness against death 14-34 days after Pfizer booster for age 50 or above relative to unvaccinated
      *  97.8% (95% CI, 94.4–99.1) after AZ primary
      *  98.7% (95% CI, 97.4–99.4) after BioNTech
* Strengths:
   * assesses the effect of the interval between dose 2 and booster
* Limitations:
   * case-control study more prone to bias
   * needs longer follow-up, relatively preliminary data
   * ""old"" data: published in January 2022

   * the adjusted HR for hospitalization due to COVID-19 in the second-booster group compared with the first-booster group was 0.36 (95% CI: 0.31–0.43)
* Strengths:
   * adequate sample size
   * cohort study providing reasonable quality evidence
   * regression identified populations with higher HR for death due to COVID-19
   * rare large scale study on second booster efficacy
   * captures enough mortality and hospitalization events for statistical significance
   * covers omicron
* Limitations:
   * short follow-up
   * based on hospital report of cause of death
   * did not evaluate breakthrough infections

# Conclusions

* barring any common pitfall encountered by the studies, the vaccines were reasonably effective in the first 6 months after vaccination up to the delta wave especially for high risk groups that received it first
* discounting vaccine efficacy altogether and claiming they have no benefit whatsoever is not supported by data
* however, the magnitude of the benefit vs. risks depends on subsequent analysis of vaccine safety
* as fast as the roll out of vaccines have been, the highest quality data on efficacy for either primary courses and subsequent boosters is struggling to catch up, compared with the many small scale and relatively low quality studies that have come out",11mn2f8,21,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/11mn2f8/are_covid19_vaccines_effective_at_all_review_of/

831,A debate on Novavax,"I'm interested in the folks thoughts on Novavax (NV for short).  For the purposes of this discussion let's assume Novavax is an honest company and not willfully pushing poison (even if you think that please).

When all this started I was dead against the MRNA, but open to NV because they were doing actual safety tests and were delayed because politics (and we know which company politics favored) and also because they had supply chain issues on quality ingredients.  Not rushing to market to wait for quality ingredients is good.  Doing longer term safety trials is good.  Politics NOT favoring you is good.  Being a traditional vax is good/better at least.  So I was on board.  


By time it released though things had changed for me.  One - I got Covid and now had natural immunity.  Two - I am not prone to conspiracy theories but even I am deeply alarmed at how desperate the powers that be are to stick a needle in my arm - any needle!  Why??  ""Get vaxed!!!!  Okay get a flu shot!  okay get a Monkeypox shot!!  Oh hey, don't you need a free vitamin B12 shot??""  I don't know what the fever is behind this, but I'm getting nervous to get blood DRAWN they're so desperate to put a needle in me.

And then THREE - and here's the main one - there seems to be safety issues anyway??  I can't sort out if these are true anti-medicine anarchists who will lie and claim all medicine is bad or if there actually is a safety concern.  Novavax is so deep in the ""noise"" there is just no reliable data.  

But then I thought what if both are true - what if it's built to be a safe vax and has a safety issue.  It's built on a dormant piece of Covid I think.  Does that imply it has a little spike protein in it and, once again, any spike protein in you is bad?  \[Does that mean Covid recovered such as myself still have spike protein in us??  Is myocarditis a concern for me too?\]

One fact that has been alarming to some is the unprecedented propaganda and censorship and fearmongering, exaggerations and blatant lies perpetrated by mainstream media in a very obviously coordinated and programmatic attack upon the human psyche that they easily perceive. 

To some people - a provaxxer is looked upon as a defeated victim of the psychological attack in the sense that they are seen to be unable to recognize it or to denounce it. But most people are not provaxxers in any sense other than being compliant and conforming subserviantly and unquestioningly. This majority could equally be situated upon the other side of the debate - were TV to guide and to instruct them accordingly. They have nothing to say in and of themselves.

One wonders then - what the provaxxer is actually saying today? How does a provaxxer treat the censorship and propaganda, the fearmongering and the hysteria it was calculated to generate? Is it simply that they cannot see it?

Abstract

This study investigated the association between vaccination with the Hepatitis B
triple series vaccine prior to 2000 and developmental disability in children aged
1–9 years (n = 1824), proxied by parental report that their child receives early
intervention or special education services (EIS). National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey 1999–2000 data were analyzed and adjusted for survey
design by Taylor Linearization using SAS version 9.1 software, with SAS callable
SUDAAN version 9.0.1. 

The odds of receiving EIS were approximately nine times as great for vaccinated boys (n = 46) as for unvaccinated boys (n = 7), after
adjustment for confounders. 

This study found statistically significant
evidence to suggest that boys in United States who were vaccinated with
the triple series Hepatitis B vaccine, during the time period in which vaccines were manufactured with thimerosal, were more susceptible to developmental disability than were unvaccinated boys.",13zy1sx,50,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/13zy1sx/this_study_found_statistically_significant/

then in my own personal experience and observations, we can say that the chance of dying from COVID is less than 1%

878,"With 70% of people injected, the Covid vaccines now pose an existential threat to the human race","Thalidomide is the prime example of the risk here. It's a drug that was freely available and even mandated, had horrible side effects, and it took many years before governments would admit there was a problem, and many more before it was banned.

But now the Covid vaccines take all that potential of a botched drug and dial up the risk to 11, especially the mRNA ones: never before used technology, rushed through testing, secret ingredient list, secret clinical trial report, secret contracts between the producing companies and governments, total shut down of anyone who speaks out about side effects...

This is infinitely more dangerous than Thalidomide ever was, and it was given to 70% of people world wide (and climbing) in just 18 months, to 90% of adults in most developed countries, all the way up to 99% of the population in some places. Approval for children was based on just two test results over a period of a year because they couldn't find evidence it had any positive effect at all, and for the boosters on just 8 mice.

They could put literally anything we want inside the vaccines, and we don't even know if the governments actually know what's in there. If the pharmaceutical companies are using brand new technology that no one outside those companies even knows about, then doesn't that mean the government would have no choice but to hire the same experts that made this tech to even understand what it is, never mind if it's safe?

And ""traditional"" vaccines are no better, AZ and J&J for sure are also using highly experimental technology. And how are we supposed to trust anything coming from Russia when Putin is the devil incarnate, or China when Chinese products were being banned in 2019 for being unsafe? What will you do if their vaccines kill you, take them to court in Russia or China? Good luck, not that you can do that in any developed country either.

So we have a bunch of totally experimental drugs (being mixed like M&Ms, increasing the risks), given to almost every human with no room for questions or testing. If now this stuff turns out to give everyone cancer, myocarditis, ADE and what not, then all the vaccinated could be dead in a matter of years. That's 70-99% of people dead, depending on where you live.

This isn't about Covid even, it's about the sheer unlimited risk in regards to long term side effects when you inject that many people that fast, which they are now admitting isn't actually making any difference for young and healthy people.

882,Can the COVID jabs cause massive death with ADE?,"About a year ago I learned what ADE is. It is when the cells of the immune system consumes a neutralized a virus and the virus uses that cell to reproduce because the antibodies actually failed to neutralize this virus. So the virus uses and destroys immune cells on top of the destruction it would normally do. This can be fatal. This happens when the immune system has antibodies either from previous infections or from vaccines but they are for fighting a slightly different virus.

In the case of the antibodies that people get from the jabs, it appears that they don't cause ADE. The producers of the jabs say that there was no evidence of ADE in the trials. Also experts say that sars-cov-2 doesn't attack immune cells. So we could say we don't have to worry about people with covid dying from ADE.

But there are some things to consider still. In animal trials of other mRNA vaccines, animals were dying from ADE. It is a reason why mRNA vaccines were not introduced to public before. Another concerning thing is that the antibodies of the covid vaccines neutralize only the spike protein on the virus. That is the protein needed to enter cells. It only makes the virus incapable of entering the cell, it leaves all the other functions of the virus going. Even after the antibodies neutralize the virus, the virus is completely capable of reproducing. So when the immune cells consume the virus, they consume a virus that has the potential to reproduce inside this cell and destroy it. This makes it very dangerous. If you think about it, it seems like the vaccines are designed to cause ADE, if they were not so, they would produce antibodies for some other protein on the virus. I don't know much but this still seems very very possible.

Experts say that these vaccines don't cause ADE because sarscov2 doesn't attack immune cells. But how close is it to attack these cells. How many mutations does sarscov2 need to start attacking immune cells? Does anybody know? Maybe all it takes is a tweak in the lab. A lab leak of an ADE variant is still a possibility to consider since it hasn't been resolved if the original variant was engineered or not.

Actually I don't know. This is the reasoning I have after getting to know a thing or two about immunity since the whole farce of covid started. Please tell me if I am wrong.

""In early January 2022, Federal Judge Mark Pittman ordered them to release 55,000 pages per month. They released 12,000 pages by the end of January.

Since then, PHMPT has posted all of the [documents](https://phmpt.org/pfizers-documents/) on its website. The latest drop happened on 1st June 2022.

One of the documents contained in the data dump is [‘reissue\_5.3.6 postmarketing experience.pdf’](https://phmpt.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/reissue_5.3.6-postmarketing-experience.pdf). Page 12 of the confidential document contains data on the use of the Pfizer Covid-19 injection in pregnancy and lactation.

### Confidential Pfizer Documents reveal 90% of Covid Vaccinated Pregnant Women lost their Baby

Pfizer state in the document that by 28th February 2021 there were 270 known cases of exposure to the mRNA injection during pregnancy.

Forty-six-percent of the mothers (124) exposed to the Pfizer Covid-19 injection suffered an adverse reaction.

Of those 124 mothers suffering an adverse reaction, 49 were considered non-serious adverse reactions, whereas 75 were considered serious. This means 58% of the mothers who reported suffering adverse reactions suffered a serious adverse event ranging from uterine contraction to foetal death.

A total of 4 serious foetus/baby cases were reported due to exposure to the Pfizer injection.


But here’s where things get rather concerning. Pfizer state that of the 270 pregnancies they have absolutely no idea what happened in 238 of them.

But here are the known outcomes of the remaining pregnancies –


There were 34 outcomes altogether at the time of the report, but 5 of them were still pending. Pfizer note that only 1 of the 29 known outcomes were normal, whilst 28 of the 29 outcomes resulted in the loss/death of the baby. This equates to 97% of all known outcomes of Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy resulting in the loss of the child.

When we include the 5 cases where the outcome was still pending it equates to 82% of all outcomes of Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy resulting in the loss of the child. This equates to an average of around 90% between the 82% and 97% figure.

So here we have our first piece of evidence that something is amiss when it comes to administering the Pfizer Covid-19 injection during pregnancy.",vwbwd0,76,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/vwbwd0/investigation_into_documents_pfizer_was_court/

A comparison of 15 months before and after vaccination rollout for that age.","If you've spent anytime in here you'll know there's a common retort to many vaccine critical posts, saying that there's many delusional 40 year olds thinking they have the risk profile of 18 year olds.

[Well, here we have some lovely stats provided by the UK ONS giving us a breakdown of deaths by single year of age from 0 to 105+. from March 2020 to April 2023](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/singleyearofageandaverageageofdeathofpeoplewhosedeathwasduetoorinvolvedcovid19)

In the 15 months up to and including May 2021 [when the vast majority of 40 year olds had their first dose](https://www.england.nhs.uk/2021/04/nhs-to-invite-all-people-40-and-over-for-life-saving-covid-19-jab/) and then the following 15 months from June 2021 onwards, here are the following stats:

Category 40 y/o| 15 Months up to & inc May 21|15 Months inc June 21 & onwards
:--------|:--------:|---------:
All Deaths|1264|1257
Involving Covid|105|89
Due to Covid|94|72

During the deadliest pandemic in history and after rollout of the safest and most effective vaccine there's ever been, all cause deaths fell by a whole 0.5% for delusional 40 year olds. 7 in absolute numbers.

Can we really attribute this massive win entirely to vaccination? Are there no other factors that contribute to this monumental change, like better treatment, already brought forward deaths, natural immunity, lifestyle changes, less deadly variants? 

No you delusional fools, it was the millions of 95% effective vaccine doses that saved 40 year olds from certain death at an absolute rate of 1.1 a month for deaths involving Covid and a monumental 1.46 a month for deaths due to Covid.

Wait wait, hold on, you haven't shown us the 18 year old stats... you're avoiding the actual comparison against 18 year olds.

Category 18 y/o | 15 Months up to & inc May 21 | 15 Months inc June 21 & onwards
:--------|:--------:|---------:
All Deaths | 203 | 270
Involving Covid | 5 | 10
Due to Covid | 3 | 5

Oh dear, I think those numbers should be going the other way, right? Why are deaths going up in all categories, 33% higher all cause deaths for 18 year olds (67 absolute)... 100% increase in deaths involving covid!? I love percentages on small numbers, thanks for that one Pfizer-bros.

From this it looks like delusional 40 year olds have it better, at least all their death rates are falling, no matter how small the changes... oh and before any pro-mRNA poster complains about vaccine not rolling out for 18 year olds until June, there were no deaths involving or from Covid for 18 year olds in June, July or August 2021... although the 18 year old all cause deaths do spike in August...right when second doses were being given ;).

Bonus points, check out page 2 and weep for all those delusional 80+ year olds that thought they had the same risk profile as delusional 40 year olds, as governments shoved recovering covid patients into care homes full of old vulnerable people.",13rohjh,12,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/13rohjh/uk_ons_stats_for_deaths_all_causes_involving/

VACCINE SCHEDULE.
Find me these studies if vaccines are so ""safe"" :
A study that proves that the vaccine schedule TODAY is safe. The cdc have been using a study from the 1980s to prove that vaccines TODAY are safe, they had 13 doses back then. It's 77 doses now.   if you can find me ONE study,  that is recent  that proves me wrong, show me because i cant find ONE that is proving these 77 DOSES are safe administered together.

VACCINE ON VACCINE CONTRAINDICATION
Show me a study that proves that non of the vaccines in any countries vax shedule have the ability to contraindicate with each other. like  said above , they use a study from the 80s to prove 13 doses was safe when we use 77+ today.
(hint, there isnt any, i couldnt find ANY)

CONTRAINDICATIONS OF VACCINE AND MEDICATION'S

you wont find any that  prove this. because all the ones that proved that all vaccines contraindicate, were censored and removed by the cdc

VACCINE TRIALS
vaccine trials only enroll HEALTHY children and or adults in the study protocol. after approval, they are reccomended to EVERYONE. healthy or not. theres no tests to prove vaccines are safe for anyone with ANY condition. how do we know that vaccines and thier ingredients dont cause a condition to worsen?
also when participants drop out due to becoming ill from the vaccines, the data analysis is done on the remaining participants therefore the results are skewed to a positive bias and negative side effects are dismissed. this is a common tactic used to make vaccines appear better than they really are.

SIDE EFFECTS ARE NOT RARE.
they are  underreported and more common than you are led to belive:
only 1% of all vaccine injuries are ever reported:
https://www.fda.gov/media/78526/download

this was posted by the uk goverment as of 2021
""It is estimated that only 10% of serious reactions and between 2 and 4% of non-serious reactions are reported""
https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/yellow-card-please-help-to-reverse-the-decline-in-reporting-of-suspected-adverse-drug-reactions

there are alot of drs and nurses who refuse to connect vaccines to anything bad, so you can report a side effect to a dr or nurse ect and they wont even bother to report it to vaers or yellow card. there are also timeframes in which you have to report a side effect or death. even if the side effect is on the table of injuries foor the vaccine. if you are 1 day over the timeline YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CLAIM OR REPORT IT. that means there is no long term analysis. what about autoimmune or other illnesses , diseases or disorders?
HHS has not made any new revisions to the table, massivly limiting table injuries to a small number of acute reactions occurring within the first 48 hours post-vaccination

THIS IS VERY COMMON AND ITS NOT ENOUGH TIME to follow the true extent of vaccine injury. vaccine trials also use other vaccines as the ""placebo"" so the rates of side effects will be near enough the same in both groups.

AI 2010 AHRQ study found at least one adverse event (AE) for every 39 vaccines given, representing a shocking injury rate of approximately 2.6%. this analyzed several years of data from 2006-2009 on 1.4 million doses of 45 different vaccines administered to over 376,000 individuals. now put that injury rate and the fact only 1% of all vaccine injuries are ever reported TO THE WHOLE POPULATION THAT HAVE HAD VACCINES.
https://digital.ahrq.gov/ahrq-funded-projects/electronic-support-public-health-vaccine-adverse-event-reporting-system

and guess what? cdc killed the pilot of this study. because it shows just how broken the reporting sytem really is. if we had real time side effects reporting, it would kill the vaccine industry.the cdc STOPPED RESPONDING TO EMAILS from the study authors.
"" “Unfortunately, there was never an opportunity to perform system performance assessments because the necessary CDC contacts were no longer available and the CDC consultants responsible for receiving data were no longer responsive to our multiple requests to proceed with testing and evaluation.”

a 2015 study that was written by the same people who did the AI study above, decided to follow a large health system in ohio with approximately one million patient encounters per year between the years  2012 and 2013. this followed patients for 6 weeks (longer than most trials but still not enough) post vaccination. it reported both suggestive events and high probability events even if the clinitian took NO ACTION. Over the course of  eight months of almost 92,000 vaccinations, the ESP-VAERS system vreated from zero to eight alerts per clinician per month (mean=0.4) and found numerous adverse outcomes including but not limited to: seizures, rashes and other allergic reactions, Bell’s palsy, pleural effusion, lymphocytopenia, and hypothyroidism. At the study’s conclusion, the researchers reported that “The odds of a VAERS report submission during the pilot period were 30.2x greater than the odds during the comparable pre-pilot period.”

""However, a decision not to immunize a child also involves risk and could put the child and others who come into contact with him or her at risk of contracting a potentially deadly disease""
how? when they would very clearly have to be infected to spread anything. vaccinated people are still shedding virus even if they show no signs of infection. the above studies in the google drive proves this. nowhere does the cdc state that after a live vaccine, you should stay away from a vunerable perosn due to ""vaccine shedding"" google, yahoo, bing ect will even imply from the results they give that vaccine shedding doesnt exist or is ""extremly"" rare...its not.

""A search of our records failed to reveal any documents beyond the records hyperlinked in the specific web site"" to support the claim that vaccines do not cause autism.  The CDC had thus revealed a truth, one that HHS could not run from in its response to ICAN’s letter.

cdc's NEW CLAIM about autism. they no longer have ""VACCINES DO NOT CAUSE AUTISM"" they now say ""there no link that vaccines dont cause autism""...even though they have no proof to make that statement.
https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html

this used to be the studies they used to say vaccines dont cause autism.... where have they gone ?
https://www.cdc.gov/%E2%80%8Cvaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html

this video (link below) is from 2002,
listen to her words, when asked ""are thimirisol vaccines still being given to children?""
karen midthun replied ""i dont think so"" YOU ARE THE REP. YOU SHOULD KNOW. then she proceded to state how there are ""thimirisol free"" vaccines, even though these ""mercury free"" contain  mercury still, (that would be considered unsafe in drinking water) or reduced thimirisol vaccines....THEN THEY ARE STILL GIVING MERCURY IN CHILDHOOD VACCINES!. lots of kids still recive the flu shot, that contains thimirisol. as does most multi strain vaccines like the mmr because they need that preservative unlike single strain vaccines. notice how she says neither yes or no?. they were lying to us.
the most damming , when asked ""can you tell me right, now......does mercury in vaccines cause autism?""
karen replies ""we can neither accept or deny a causal relationship between autism and thimirisol...we dont know one way or the other""  THEY HAVE NO PROOF THAT VACCINES DONT CAUSE AUTISM. yet the cdc, the nhs, the who, gavi ....all say vaccines dont cause autism!!

shes aslo states that the flu shot has shown to be safe and effective, not according to the science. the cochrane institue has done the biggest meta study on this by comparing ALL the litrature.... they dont work, the immunity wanes, the protection is negligable at best. again, we are lied to.

ANDREW WAKEFIELD
then theres andrew akefield. his claim was never that vaccines caused autism. his claim was that multi strain vaccines like the mmr were responsible for irritble bowl disease and other digestive issues that could CONTRIBUTE to autism. when in nature are you going to come into contact with mumps measles and rubella all at once? or diptheria, purtussis and tetanus?
his research was replicated 28 TIMES. yet hes still called a quack.

UNAVOIDABLY UNSAFE

RETROVIRUSES
Show me a study that proves the dna added from cows, pigs, chickens, hamsters, cats, dogs and aborted fetal dna ect is safe. (hint, there isn't any)  I COULDNT FIND ANY. and the amounts used in vaccines are UNKOWN.
did you know all animals on earth contain retroviruses within thier dna? we have them too. every time you have a vaccine or a needle of any medication that contains ANY animal cell or aborted fetal cell line....YOU ARE GETTING THESE RETROVIRUSES. simian virus 40 (sv40) is a monkey retrovirus that was taken from monkey kidney, ITS LINKED TO CANCER and is the POSSIBLE cause of HIV and AIDS.  sv40 contaminated both polio vaccines of the 30s and 60s. look back to when they started vaccinating africa for polio in the 30s...hiv and aids started popping up at the same time.
the book ""the river"" explains this well.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p0F5RMo0JGARdkAQQ5TxM3o2rFRdVyoJ/view?usp=sharing
a video of maurice hillerman admitting the polio vaccine was CONTAMINATED WITH SV40. and hes laughing about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuLmnyPX7gE
monkeys contain thousands of these retroviruses as does every other animal on earth.not only are some vaccines grew in multiple animal cell lines but they are ""attenuated"" through multiple animal cell lines. imagine the possible virus rna recombination from that. this in my opinion, is whats causing rapid mutation and cross species infection at the rate we are experiencing today. imagine all the possible health conditions caused by these retroviruses that we are injecting and dont even know it. ill end this here.

VACCINE VS ""NATURAL"" AQUIRED IMMUNITY
whats the diffrence between being vaccinated and encountering any viruses naturally ie from being coughed or sneezed on? if its too dangerous to be coughed or sneezed, ITS TOO DANGEROUS TO BE INJECTED. end of story. id rather be coughed on than have a vaccine. less harmful, no injected chemicals, no carcinogenic,mutagenic or teratogenic ingredients. no pathonagenic priming, i get to build my immune system ...win win .

this study proves that mothers who were vaccinated with measles DID NOT have babies who were immune to measles. the babies even had a higher risk of catching it .
""Children of mothers vaccinated against measles and, possibly, rubella have lower concentrations of maternal antibodies and lose protection by maternal antibodies at an earlier age than children of mothers in communities that oppose vaccination. This increases the risk of disease transmission in highly vaccinated populations""

also, the measles vaccine can give you mealses... any vaccine that contains virus can. thats is medical fact. you can also vaccine shed it to others, so if you get vaccine dervived mealses, it can affect your immune system for up to 5 years, bearing in mind this only effects around 20% of all people who get measles:

SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME
as of 2020 since the pandemic started, vaccination has gone down AS HAD SIDS by 30% (sudden infant death syndrome) explain that? people certainly arent eating better or exercising more since lockdown... alot of countries have seen dips in both premature births since lockdown too.
show me a study that proves vaccine doesnt cause sids?

In 2017, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled that there was “preponderant evidence” supporting a claim that vaccines “caused or substantially contributed” to a 2011 SIDS death.
https://ecf.cofc.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2013vv0611-73-0

American children receive more vaccines in their first year than children anywhere in the world and way more than during the 1980s. Most of these vaccines are administered in bundles at well-baby visits around two and four months—exactly when nine out of ten SIDS deaths occur.

""Sudden infant death following hexavalent vaccination: a neuropathologic study""

A case report from 2008, also by Italian researchers, described a three-month-old infant who died within 24 hours of receiving a hexavalent vaccine.
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18538957/

""Most deaths (96%) were in children aged 12 months or younger; most (52%) had sudden infant death syndrome as the reported cause of death""
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26289956/

The researchers found that half (51%) of all the adverse events reported for hepatitis B-containing vaccines were for children under two years of age, and SIDS was the most commonly reported cause of death.
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29241647/

Almost seven in ten deaths (68.4%) were in children, 57% of whom were male. Death certificates or autopsy reports, available for about 85% of child deaths, showed that SIDS was the top cause of death (44%), with asphyxia (6%) occupying second place. Although the CDC authors reported (for the child death reports) that “79.4% received >1 vaccine on the same day,” they noted “no concerning pattern.”

VAERS.
look at the charts here. this is a list of all ""on the table"" side effects. theres never been any long term studies on vaccines, if a person sues for a brand new side effect and they win, it ges onto the table. if someone has a reaction 28 (or spefified time) DAYS AFTER, they cannot take the claim to vaccine court. diffrent injuries have diffrent timescales. shoulder injury caused by the injection is 4 hours, so you have to lodge a compalaint WITHIN 4 HOURS. also note the side effects. did the dr or nurse inform you that these could be the possible side effects? encephelitis, encepholophy, brain damage, severe allergic reactions, gullian barre syndrome, DEATH, seizures, a new one called PERVASIVE BEHAVIOURAL DISORDER aka autism....

as an explample, a pro vax website. the cdc, the nhs ect
they dont tell you all the possible side effects. only the ""mild and common"" ones. apparently there is no risk of autism or developmental issues even though mercury and alluminim is linked to them. even though the fda and the cdc have never provied any bias free, solid proof that there ISNT a risk.

922,Talking points I think could use improvement,"Just for a introduction, I am against the covid vaccine. I go further than just saying ""take it if you want"". Yes, people are free to do that but where it stands now, there is no informed consent. I was antivax long before covid too. 

Here are a list of things I hear people say that I feel aren't helping the debate:

""The science has changed again""

We complain about them saying ""the science is settled"". We can't have it both ways. If Covid truely was the freak event that was a total surprise (I absolutely don't think that), there would be updates on information. This is the establishment trying to present a realistic progression of the ""new information"".

""It's not even a vaccine, it's a gene therapy ""

Yes, this is technically true. The reason I don't like this statement is because it implies if it *were* a real vaccine, all would been good. I also don't particularly like to word ""therapy "", because that word is usually associated with something helpful and good for your health.

""It's a brand new vaccine with no long-term studies""

There are plenty of medication that have harms that have been around for quite some time. In this climate of corruption, I believe that this vaccine could be something covered up for a long time. 

""It's not FDA approved ""

I don't know about you, but I won't be taken it even it it were. The FDA is fully controlled. Even before covid they couldn't be trusted. There is some debate on whether or not the Pfizer vaccine is actually approved. It appears that some legalese was used to make it appear that way. All more reason not to trust the government, big pharma, the media, & the regulatory agencies (big pharma). 

""I'm not taking a vaccine for a virus with a survival rate of 99%+""

So when the ""next one that'll get their attention"" comes along, are you gonna take the new one?

Maybe I'm being too much of a purist here. These are just scenerios I think people should think about ahead of time. Words matter and it's important to be precise in our language. Do some ""what if"" mind experiments and have a plan. This isn't the end. Major hardships are ahead and you might have to make some tough decisions, whether it's regarding future pandemics or some other manufactured event that causes the government to steal more power & money.",13rcj97,21,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/13rcj97/talking_points_i_think_could_use_improvement/

929,Discrimination against the vaccine injured.,"I have been watching people who have been injured by the Covid - 19 vaccines talking about their experiences recently, and one of the shocking things I have found is that some people have been attacked, vilified and denigrated simply for sharing their stories, at a time when they are experiencing the most acute suffering imaginable. I think that such attacks are no different from other forms of discrimination such as race/sex/gender discrimination yet they seem to originate not in a failure of education/socialization/ethical awareness - but in something much darker - a toxic hatred, and an unmoderated rampant psychosis.

936,Covid death rate in New Zealand 0.04%. or 99.96% survival rate. If you are under 60 and healthy likely 100% survival rate. If uou are a kid 100% survival rate. Less than 500 dead per year. Lower than the average flu deaths per year pre covid.,"[Link to New Zealands up to date data. ](https://www.health.govt.nz/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-data-and-statistics/covid-19-current-cases).

About a year ago we finally got data that separates died with covid and died from covid.  It dropped covid deaths by 60 or 70%.  The media still reports with not of.

1679 is the number of deaths since we first got covid in new Zealand 3 years and 4 months ago.

4209 is the total number of deaths I'd we include anyone that died within 28 days of getting covid.

They claim 2313064 cases have been reported.  That's approximately half our population yet it's hard to find a person who hasn't had it.

Many kids cases would have gone unported as symptoms are so mild you wouldn't know.

Most studies I've looked at estimate at least 80% of the population have had covid.  So for new Zealand that would be 4million.

So by those numbers.

4 million = 0.042%
2313064 =  0.073%.

At worst case if you include the 977 that supposedly had covid as contributor to death ( cancer patient on deathbed gets covid and they die a few weeks sooner).

And includ the people that dubiously died after 28 days of getting covid.  We have a total of 2736 deaths. 

4 million =  0.068
2313064 = 0.12

So we have a survival rate for covid which is somewhere from 99.88% to 99.96%.

99.88% is official recorded numbers and being generous and 99.96% is likely closer to reality.

Almost all of those deaths would have been in people with comorbidities.

Over 3.4 years that's s less than 500 people dead per year.  Pre covid, flu deaths rate was 500 to 800 a year.  During covid it was zero.

The tldr is that there is an increase in self-reported changes, however none of the papers show long lasting changes and the changes are generally small and clinically insignifiant, only affecting quality of life. The authors do agree that more research is needed in this area. This explains why JTW finds it of concern in the latest PV video. It has been proposed that this is not uncommon for other vaccines and may simply be due to the elicited immune response.

Edit: to be clear, there are changes that for certain subgroups are significant, but there are no long lasting effects and no changes are required in clinical management.",10sobrm,31,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/10sobrm/peer_reviewed_studies_on_whether_the_vaccine/

#What is Measles? It’s Basically a Rash

According to The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP):

>“Measles is an acute viral disease characterized by fever, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, followed by a maculopapular rash beginning on the face and spreading cephalocaudally and centrifugally.”

What does that mean?

* Cough is a cough.

* Coryza means inflammation of the mucous membrane in the nose. Most people call this a “stuffy nose.”

* Conjunctivitis is often called “pink eye,” a common eye disease, especially in children. It usually lasts a few days and goes away by itself.

* Maculopapular rash is a type of rash that is covered with small bumps. It can sometimes be itchy. 

* Cephalocaudally and Centrifugally means moving downward and away from center.

So, according to pediatricians, measles is a rash that can sometimes be itchy and spread across the body. It may cause a stuffy nose and pink eye.

Although measles is basically a rash, we are told that the complications can be serious and sometimes deadly. 

Let’s see what the CDC said before there was a vaccine.

According to the former head of the CDC, Dr. Alexander D. Langmuir, measles is a

>“self-limiting infection of short duration, moderate severity, and low fatality….”

>Medical Importance of Measles, Alexander Langmuir, MD. Am J Dis Child, 1962;103(3):224-226.

He said this in 1962, **before** the measles vaccine was in use. 

The term self-limiting means a disease that tends to go away on its own, without treatment.

According to an article published in The American Journal of Public Health:

>“By the early 1960’s, almost all children contracted measles before they reached adolescence…By 1960, thanks to the use of antibiotics and improvements in living conditions, measles mortality was declining steadily in industrialized countries. Parents largely came to see measles as an unpleasant, although more or less inevitable, part of childhood…Many primary care physicians shared this view.”

>Measles Vaccination Before the Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine. Hendriks, MSc and Stuart Blume, PhD, Am J Public Health. 2013 August; 103(8): 1393–1401.

#What About Complications from Measles?

What are we told about the complications from measles today?  This table is from the CDC:

*Measles Complications*

*Diarrhea 8%*

*Otitis media (earaches) 7%*

*Pneumonia 6%*

*Encephalitis (brain inflammation) 0.1%*

*Seizures 0.6%-0.7%*

*Death 0.2%*

All of these complications rates are from **1985-1992**. If measles was really so dangerous, **why is the CDC relying on data that’s over 30 years old**?

#No Children Have Died from Measles in the U.S. in the Last Five Years

The CDC states that the measles death rate is .2% which means that for every 1,000 children who get measles, two will die from it. On their Measles website under “Complications,” they say:

>“Death from measles was reported in approximately 0.2% of the cases in the United States from 1985 through 1992.” 

Their table says deaths are .2%, that’s a number from about 30 years ago.  In fact, all of those above complications are reported from 1985-1992.

From 2015-2019, there were a total of 2,051 measles cases in the U.S. From 2015-2019 the U.S. population was about 320 million. 

That means that your chance of getting measles was between **.000004 – .000003**. Your chance of dying from measles in the U.S. if you are an adult was **.0000000006**. If you are a child it was **zero**.

#Listed Measles Vaccine Side Effects

Merck makes the measles (MMR) vaccines and the company lists a number of potential side effects associated with this vaccine. The following is a list from the manufacturer’s insert. This is the FDA required document that describes what is known about a particular vaccine or medication.

Merck states:

>“The following adverse reactions are listed in decreasing order of severity, without regard to causality, within each body system category and have been reported during clinical trials, with use of the marketed vaccine, or with use of monovalent or bivalent vaccine containing measles, mumps, or rubella:

That means when injected, the vaccinated will produce spike proteins based specifically on the DNA code that came from China.

Now if China tampered with that code, in a way that is so subtle that even experts can't see it, then the vaccinated now carry a spike protein that does not occur naturally, and the only way to get it is through vaccination.

The problem with that is that anyone with the technical capability could now build a bioweapon virus that will only target people who carry said specific made in China DNA code. The most likely culprit being China itself, which has long said it considers bioweapon a fair way to conduct war, and is open about its ambition to conquer the whole of Asia.

Of course that would also pose a risk to China if they vaccinated all their people... but did they actually do that? Have we any way of knowing if China actually injected their people with the same DNA code? Who says they didn't just give everyone a placebo? Nor are the exported Chinese vaccines any indicator, they could have made a different version just for export. We do know that China told its people not to take any foreign vaccines.
